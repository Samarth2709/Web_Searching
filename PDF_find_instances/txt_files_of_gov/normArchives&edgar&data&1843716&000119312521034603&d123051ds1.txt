PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS
$400,000,000
Post Holdings Partnering Corporation
40,000,000 Units
Post Holdings Partnering Corporation is a newly organized company, incorporated as a Delaware corporation, established for the purpose of identifying a company to partner with in order to effectuate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar partnering transaction with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as a “partnering transaction.” We have not selected any company to partner with and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any company to partner with regarding a partnering transaction. We may pursue a partnering transaction with any company in any industry. While we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, given the experience of our management team, our partnering transaction and value creation strategy will be to identify and build a company in partnership with a company, its management team and existing owners.
(Prospectus cover continued on the following page.)
We are an “emerging growth company” under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. Investing in our securities involves risks. See “Risk Factors” on page 43. Investors will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings.

$0.20 per unit, or $8,000,000 in the aggregate (or $9,200,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), is payable upon the closing of this offering. Includes $0.35 per unit, or $14,000,000 in the aggregate (or up to $16,100,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions to be placed in a trust account located in the United States and released to the underwriters only upon the completion of a partnering transaction. See also “Underwriting” for a description of compensation and other items of value payable to the underwriters.
Of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement units described in this prospectus, $400.0 million, or $460.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months from the closing of this offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for a partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering, which we refer to as an “agreement in principle event” throughout this prospectus) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
The underwriters are offering the units for sale on a firm commitment basis. Delivery of the units will be made on or about                      , 2021.

Table of Contents
(Prospectus cover continued from preceding page.)
This is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of our Series A common stock and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus, and only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction and 12 months from the closing of this offering, and will expire five years after the completion of our partnering transaction or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, as described in this prospectus. Subject to the terms and conditions described in this prospectus, we may redeem the warrants once the warrants become exercisable. We have also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 6,000,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any.
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of our Series A common stock upon the completion of our partnering transaction at a per-share price described in this prospectus, payable in cash, subject to the limitations described herein. If we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering, or 27 months following an agreement in principle event, as such period may be extended, we will redeem 100% of the public shares at a per-share price described in this prospectus, payable in cash, subject to applicable law.
Our sponsor, PHPC Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (which we refer to as our “sponsor” throughout this prospectus), is a wholly owned subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc., a Missouri corporation (which we refer to as “Post” throughout this prospectus). Our sponsor will commit to purchase an aggregate of 1,200,000 units (or 1,320,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per unit ($12,000,000 in the aggregate, or $13,200,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. The private placement units are identical to the units sold in this offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in this prospectus.
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, consisting of one share of Series B common stock, or a “forward purchase share,” and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, or a “forward purchase warrant,” for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units. The terms of the forward purchase warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in this offering.
As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor holds 11,500,000 shares of Series F common stock (which we refer to as our “founder shares” throughout this prospectus), up to 1,500,000 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised. The shares of Series F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Series B common stock at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis. Prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock.
Prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, only holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to elect our directors and may remove members of our board of directors for any reason. On any vote to approve our partnering transaction or on any other matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction, holders of our Series A common stock, holders of our Series B common stock, if any, and holders of our Series F common stock will generally vote together as a single class, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of our common stock entitling the holder to one vote. Following our partnering transaction, holders of our Series A common stock and holders of our Series B common stock will generally vote together as a single class on all matters presented for a stockholder vote, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of Series A common stock entitling the holder to one vote per share and each share of Series B common stock entitling the holder to ten votes per share.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our units, Series A common stock or warrants. We intend to apply to list our units on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol “                .U” on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on the NYSE. The Series A common stock and warrants constituting the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such date is not a business day, the following business day), unless Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to certain conditions. Once the securities constituting the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Series A common stock and warrants will be listed on the NYSE under the symbols “                ” and “                WS” respectively.
We are responsible for the information contained in this prospectus. We have not authorized anyone to provide any information or to make any representations other than those contained in this prospectus. We and the underwriters take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. This prospectus is an offer to sell only the units offered hereby, but only under circumstances and in jurisdictions where it is lawful to do so. The information contained in this prospectus is current only as of its date.

Company
Post is a consumer packaged goods holding company with a long history of value creation via strategic corporate actions and efficient capital allocation. Post is forming our company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our “partnering transaction.” An affiliate of Post will act as our sponsor. We have not selected any business with which to partner and have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any candidate with respect to a partnering transaction with us. Although we may pursue a partnering transaction in any industry, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team and our sponsor to partner with a business that has the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) industry.

Post generated 279% in total shareholder return since its spin-off from Ralcorp Holdings in 2012 until the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020 – the highest among Post’s packaged food industry peers. From Post’s spin-off through December 31, 2020, Post generated 278% in total shareholder return, still among the highest of its peers, despite being impacted by the pandemic’s effect on its foodservice business. To achieve these results, Post has transformed from a single-product participant in a secularly declining category into a growing, diversified enterprise across multiple categories.
      1.
Fiscal year ended 9/30/2011. Reflects Net Sales for Post.
2.
Fiscal year ended 9/30/2020. Reflects Net Sales for Post and its equity investments, comprised of Post consolidated Net Sales of $5.7bn, which includes 100% of BellRing Brands, Inc. (“BellRing”), plus $924 million in Net Sales for 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. (“8th Avenue”).
This transformation was accomplished by utilizing the following strategic guiding principles:
    •  
Long-tenured management team. We believe Post has the longest-tenured management team among its publicly-traded packaged food industry peers, with its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel having joined Post in various capacities in 2011. This continuity and cohesive team structure has created a strong, collaborative culture with significant accumulated institutional knowledge and transaction expertise.
    •  
De-centralized operating structure. Post’s corporate management recognizes that the “operator” skill set is often different than the “capital allocation” or mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) skill set. As such, Post retains an operationally-focused management team to run each of its business units and centralizes the capital allocation function. This structure allows each of Post’s business units to achieve operational excellence and be agile and nimble, while remaining autonomous from, but accountable to, the corporate management team at Post. This also enables corporate management to focus on efficient capital allocation and accretive M&A and structured transactions on a holistic basis across the portfolio.

Table of Contents
  •  
Creative and pragmatic approach to M&A. Post’s corporate management possesses a deep M&A proficiency, employing leverage and transaction structure to enhance returns. Unlike some corporations with M&A in their DNA, Post is not solely an asset accumulator, but rather seeks to monetize assets opportunistically to unlock shareholder value.
    •  
Broad access to deal flow. Given Post’s extensive M&A track-record and heavy use of the capital markets, corporate management has regular direct contact with various management teams, Board members, and sell-side bankers. The Post team is well suited to transact in situations that require creativity, complexity, or structuring expertise.
    •  
Appropriate use of leverage to enhance equity returns. Post’s corporate management actively manages its balance sheet and has a sophisticated understanding of the capital markets. Since its spin-off, Post has undertaken over 30 capital markets transactions and maintained leverage in a range of 4.0x to 6.0x for most of that time.
Post intends to apply these primary strategic principles to capitalize on the substantial deal flow and opportunity that management sees across the consumer sector. As such, we are seeking to partner with a business in an attractive category, with growth potential organically or through consolidation opportunities, margin upside potential, portfolio optionality, and an experienced management team. Post Management believes that PHPC’s formation, and its position outside of the immediate Post corporate structure, greatly expands the potential universe of targets and target financial profiles that could potentially generate attractive returns for shareholders. We are open to assessing high-growth partners, yet prioritize other criteria, as outlined in Our Investment Criteria. The partnering transaction would provide the candidate business an efficient path to become public, backed by Post’s experience managing consumer products businesses, allocating capital, and building a foundation for future acquisitions and value creation. As a long-term partner, Post will enhance the potential candidate’s ability to generate risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.
Capitalizing on Post’s History
Post’s history is rooted in M&A as a lever for value-creation against an ever-evolving CPG category backdrop.
Post’s legacy dates back to 1895, when C. W. Post incorporated Postum Cereals Company and developed one of the first ready-to-eat (“RTE”) cereal, Grape-Nuts, in 1897. The company became the first packaged food consolidator, as Postum Cereals Company acquired over a dozen companies between 1925 and 1929, expanding its product line to more than 60 products and eventually changing its name to General Foods Corporation.
Philip Morris Companies (“Philip Morris”) acquired the business in 1985 and subsequently merged the business with Kraft Foods Inc. (“Kraft”) in 1989. In 2007, Kraft was separated from Philip Morris, and in 2008, the Post cereals business was split-off from Kraft and combined with Ralcorp Holdings (“Ralcorp”), a manufacturer of private label packaged food. Ultimately, Post was spun-off from Ralcorp and became a separate, standalone company, effective February 3, 2012.
Post’s character as an early food industry consolidator re-emerged when it once again became a standalone public company. A component of management’s initial mandate was to consolidate the RTE cereal category. At the same time, the category began to experience a more pronounced shift in consumption, after decades of low-to-mid single digit growth. Consumers began to exhibit a preference for low-carbohydrate diets, natural ingredients, or non-processed foods, and were substituting protein-based options for cereals. In the face of enhanced competition in a growth-constrained environment, Post developed a diversification strategy that prioritized performance stability and free cash flow generation. Management recognized early and


  4
Table of Contents
positioned its portfolio accordingly around long-term consumer trends. To diversify its cereal offerings, some of management’s first acquisitions were focused on building a foothold in protein products relevant to the breakfast daypart, both for at-home and on-the-go eating occasions. The acquisitions of Michael Foods and Premier Protein allowed Post to unlock desired strategic diversity. Post later was able to translate those early actions into future value creation when it carved out BellRing, which held Post’s active nutrition businesses including Premier Protein, highlighting that Post is not an asset accumulator, and instead seeks to crystallize value when possible to maximize long-term returns for shareholders. In total, Post has acquired 16 businesses since 2012, growing net sales nearly six times and Adjusted EBITDA over five times.
      1.
Post’s fiscal year end is September 30
Central to Post’s value creation strategy is the simple notion of accessing capital at a reasonable cost and investing the capital in consumer assets with appropriate risk-adjusted return potential. Over its history, Post has been an active issuer in different capital markets including high-yield debt (both term loans and bonds), convertible preferred equity, mandatory convertible equity, and common equity. In addition, Post has also partnered with private equity capital providers (via its formation of 8th Avenue), as well as the public equity markets (via its BellRing carve-out initial public offering, “IPO”). Post management views the market for blank check companies as a natural extension of this strategy of leveraging its capital base through creative financial structures.
Post management believes that the current combination of macro, market, and contextual opportunity have combined to make the present moment the right time to explore value-accretive transactions where Post can apply its core M&A skill set outside of the immediate Post corporate structure. Both Post shareholders and PHPC shareholders have the opportunity to benefit from the formation of PHPC and the complementary, aligned objectives that will guide its pursuit of value creation.
Differentiated Sponsor
Our sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post. Post operates as a holding company for six distinct businesses today. Four of the businesses are wholly-owned, including Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix, Foodservice, and Refrigerated Retail. Two of the businesses are held as investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries. BellRing is Post’s historical active nutrition business. Post completed an IPO of a minority interest in BellRing in October 2019, monetizing a 28.8% stake in the business while retaining 71.2% for upside in the public markets. 8th Avenue is Post’s historical private brand business, which Post capitalized separately with investments from third parties in October 2018, retaining a 60.5% stake for future upside potential and optionality. Post is familiar with operating as a public company with a complex organizational structure, making it an ideal partner to PHPC.

Post’s operating model with its existing subsidiaries is similar to the expected relationship with our ultimate partner, making Post uniquely qualified to sponsor our business. Each of Post’s six businesses has its own management and operating structure, while capital allocation and M&A are centrally-managed by Post. The subsidiary businesses are unified, but not operationally integrated, by select shared services across the portfolio related to food safety, regulatory and compliance oversight; treasury; finance; investor relations; tax; select information technology; human resources; and corporate legal. De-centralization allows each business to flexibly and quickly respond to market movements, and enables them to be separated in the future without significant disintegration effects or stranded costs.
Stemming from its own strategic principles, Post intends to provide the following support to the ultimate partner as sponsor:
    •  
Consumer products industry expertise and relationships. Post’s management team has a collective 100+ years of industry experience in consumer products. Rob Vitale additionally serves on the board of directors of Energizer Holdings, Inc., a publicly-traded company operating in the household products category. The management team’s relationships with business managers and operators across all corporate functions, as well as among the financial communities that invest in CPG businesses, provides the partnering candidate access to best-in-class leadership and strategic acumen.
    •  
M&A experience and capabilities, including access to deal flow. Post has completed 16 acquisitions since 2012, building the relationships that place it at the nexus of deal flow between strategic and sponsor transactions, while developing the resources and experience to move quickly and decisively. Since future M&A opportunity is a major consideration in our selection of an ultimate partner, Post would be a valuable resource.
      1.
Transformative acquisitions are defined as transactions with a purchase price >$1,000 million
    •  
Tax and structuring expertise and resources. Post’s own corporate organization and transaction experience provide administrative resources and third party relationships that will help optimize corporate and deal structure.
    •  
Capitalization formation and ongoing balance sheet management. Post already provides treasury services to its business units as well as to its affiliate investments under master services agreements, so an extension of its guidance to our business would be a natural step to leverage its expertise. Post takes a thoughtful, appropriately aggressive, and proactive approach to balance sheet management, having flexed up and down leverage for acquisitions since its spin-off.
    •  
Experienced manager of a public company. Post management has deep expertise in leading a public company. Post intends to leverage its experience to support the partnering candidate as it enters the public markets for the first time.
    •  
Potential shared services. While we will not be integrated into Post as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we expect to have a similar relationship to the sponsor as Post’s current subsidiaries. Post and

  management will take into account potential revenue and cost synergies that might be available based on common capabilities, customers, operations, or distribution channels in evaluating potential partnering opportunities; Post may be able to offer certain administrative services to leverage costs across a larger portfolio.
Post aims to help build a foundation for our long-term success, and will lend its expertise, resources, and guidance, backed by its initial financial commitment, to start our journey as a public company.
Post’s Investment Track Record Is Highly Relevant Across the Consumer Landscape
When Post became a standalone public company in 2012, it was a single-category business operating in the highly-competitive RTE cereal category with concentrated distribution channels in food, drug, mass, and club, offering only center-of-store products. Since then, Post has transformed into a dynamic, multi-category food company with diversified income streams and portfolio optionality. Post’s experience is relevant across the CPG industry as many categories face similar dynamics.
A core element of Post’s strategy relates to empowering management teams to operate toward a model that prioritizes top-line stability, margin enhancement, free cash flow generation, and agile responses to consumer preferences. The de-centralized model is intentionally designed to increase individual unit’s flexibility, accountability, and entrepreneurship. Post’s performance demonstrates management’s ability to effectively incentivize and guide capital allocation decisions without crafting or developing each unit’s specific operating or go-to-market strategy.
Layered on top of organic growth is a discerning approach to inorganic expansion. Management has acquired 16 companies ranging from sub-$100 million to ~$2.45 billion in size since 2012. Despite the broad diversity in size, category, geography, and other business characteristics, Post’s strategy has been consistent. That is, to build leadership positions in categories with attractive dynamics, diversify the total portfolio by expanding into new categories and channels, while addressing secular themes in food to insulate the portfolio from potential dietary, lifestyle or economic shifts. Post utilizes tax benefits (as appropriate and available) and aims to extract synergies where possible, using integration expertise to buy down the effective purchase multiple and enhance value creation. However, given Post’s de-centralized operating structure and diversified portfolio approach, synergies are not a pre-requisite for pursuing an acquisition that makes strategic sense or unlocks long-term strategic value.
Adherence to its upfront acquisition criteria, combined with effective integration that does not prioritize extreme cost-focused synergy extraction, has enhanced the return of Post’s portfolio and resulted in a strong track record of nearly all M&A targets performing ahead of the acquisition case under Post’s stewardship.

Post’s results with its own business are a clear indicator of its track record. Post has driven attractive total returns for its shareholders and has delivered returns in excess of its peers since its formation.
    Post has also monetized assets opportunistically, using structured M&A to generate return while simultaneously retaining potential future upside. On October 1, 2018, Post completed an independent capitalization of 8th Avenue, providing gross proceeds to Post of $875 million while allowing Post to retain 60.5% in common equity post-closing. 8th Avenue is now a deconsolidated equity investment that is owned jointly with third party investors. On October 21, 2019, BellRing completed an initial public offering, providing net proceeds to Post of $524 million while allowing Post to retain a 71.2% ownership stake. BellRing remains fully-consolidated in Post’s financial results. Based on its current valuation in the public equity markets as of December 31, 2020, BellRing has achieved a more than six times increase in the entity’s enterprise value since the businesses were acquired and combined by Post in 2014. Post is therefore positioned to continue to realize

As a sponsor, Post will be providing us with differentiated expertise as a result of its track record of identifying high potential businesses as well as its differentiated access to a deep network of investors worldwide. Additionally, Post’s franchise strength brings capital, credibility, and institutional know-how to execute the partnering transaction quickly.
Our Business Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, partner with and, after our partnering transaction, fundamentally enhance a company in the public markets. We intend to partner with a company in the consumer products industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and is a business to which we believe we can add value.
Our management team is deeply familiar with the trends of our target industries and brings an investing approach that offers multiple competitive advantages in sourcing, evaluating and executing on opportunities, including:
    •  
Long-term investment horizon. We take a long-term, strategic view when evaluating our various operating businesses and are less concerned with seeking profits based on near-term volatility or temporary market disruptions.
    •  
Attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe we can create significant value through efficient capital allocation, appropriately aggressive balance sheet management and a business model that focuses on outsized growth prospects and free cash flow generation.
    •  
Sophisticated transaction structuring to enhance value. We will be creative in our deal structures in order to maximize value creation for our prospective investors and shareholders.

Table of Contents
  •  
Differentiated partner sourcing across consumer sectors. Post management is at the nexus of deal flow for both strategics and sponsors. We believe that the capabilities and connections of our management team, in combination with those of Post, will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of partnering opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the M&A markets to replicate.
    •  
Speed and agility to consummate a partnering transaction. Our team has proven managerial expertise in deal execution having previously acquired and divested a number of businesses. We believe that we will be able to conduct candidate sourcing, screening, diligence and execution thoughtfully and efficiently as opportunities arise.
Our Investment Criteria
We have identified general criteria and guidelines for selecting an appropriate target, which we believe are important in evaluating prospective partnering businesses:
    •  
Fundamental business value. We look for businesses with consumer utility, strong brand awareness, and unique value propositions anchored by effective distribution and solid household penetration. We are also looking for businesses that are future-forward and disruptive in the way that they operate and/or the value proposition that they offer to consumers.
    •  
Attractive categories within the consumer products industry broadly. Categories where competitive dynamics remain supportive of growth opportunities, there are pockets of growth or pent-up demand, adjacency opportunities, multiple routes to market, or consolidation potential.
    •  
Well-established strategic moat. Entrenched, defensible leadership positions in core growth categories.
    •  
Strong margin potential. Attractive Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin performance with identifiable opportunities for organic growth and operating leverage through increased scale.
    •  
Strong free cash flow capability. Limited capital expenditure needs and modest working capital requirements to drive strong cash generation.
    •  
Portfolio optionality. Our goal is to build multiple paths to value creation, either with in-bound or out-bound M&A. We favor businesses with platform opportunities, where the structure of a candidate enables building or disaggregating consumer products businesses over time.
    •  
Experienced management team. We will seek to partner with deep, experienced and talented management teams to lead the business and have responsibility for driving operating results.
    •  
Desire to become a standalone public company. We will seek to partner with a business that has a desire to become a standalone public company and retain its economic autonomy.
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our partnering transaction with a candidate that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular partnering transaction may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting our partnering transaction consistent with our business objectives. In the event that we decide to enter into our partnering transaction with a candidate that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the candidate does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our partnering transaction, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Our Competitive Strengths
The sourcing, valuation, diligence, and execution capabilities of our management team and Post will provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise. Our competitive strengths include the following core principles by which we govern ourselves:
    •  
Long-term orientation. Closing our partnering transaction is important but we are intensely focused on long-term share price performance and the interests of common shareholders post-closing.
    •  
Partnership model. We are not reliant on finding a company which needs operational improvement, cost cutting or replacing senior management. We are not activist investors. We are not buyout specialists. We are not short-term promoters. We have a long-term partnership mentality and collaborative investment model which is grounded and driven by our belief in fairness and alignment of interests.
    •  
Committed co-investment capital. Post intends to utilize its balance sheet to co-invest alongside public market investors. We believe that our initial committed capital in conjunction with our aligned economic interests will allow us to partner with a high quality company.
    •  
Continued ownership. We are focused on partnering with management teams who are focused on long- term compounded growth and existing owners who may want to continue ownership in a high quality asset but need to provide liquidity to existing shareholders and/or limited partners. PHPC provides an ability to transition ownership to the public market, which is deeper and more liquid than the private market, in a disciplined fashion and for existing owners to share in the future upside potential over the long term.
    •  
Deep experience of our sponsor and our management team. We believe that our ability to leverage the operational experience of Post, which has completed over 16 acquisitions since 2012 across a wide spectrum of size, subsector, and ownership structure will provide us with a distinct advantage in being able to source, diligence, and add value post-closing of the partnering transaction.
    •  
Differentiated sourcing channels with leading industry, private equity, and venture capital relationships. Our management team and sponsor believe the capabilities and connections associated with our management team will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of partnering opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We expect these sourcing capabilities will be further bolstered by our management team’s reputation and deep industry, private equity, and venture capital relationships.
    •  
Investing experience. Our management team and sponsor believe that our management’s track record of identifying and sourcing transactions in the consumer sector positions us well to appropriately evaluate potential partnering candidates and select one that will be well received by the public markets and our shareholders.
    •  
Post-closing value-add capabilities and requirement. Our management team and sponsor believe that our combined expertise and reputation will allow us to drive meaningful value post-closing with the partner company. If our value-add is not readily identifiable, then we will choose not to execute that partnering transaction.
We believe our ability to complete a partnering transaction will be enhanced by our having entered into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit that it will purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, each consisting of one forward purchase share and one-fifth of one forward purchase warrant, for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction.


  11
Table of Contents
The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units. The terms of the forward purchase warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in this offering.
Our Process
In evaluating a prospective partnering candidate, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, inspection of physical assets, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us. We will employ third party diligence to support our internal efforts where appropriate. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a partnering transaction without the prior consent of our sponsor.
We are not prohibited from pursuing a partnering transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our partnering transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities following this offering, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular candidate is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our partnering transaction. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular partnering transaction if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a candidate business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our partnering transaction.
As described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities, including, in certain cases to Post, pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of our sponsor or any of our directors and officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their business combinations. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our partnering transaction. We believe that potential conflicts with Post are naturally mitigated by the differing nature of the investments Post would typically consider most synergistic to the existing Post businesses and the types of transactions we expect to find most attractive based, in part, on transaction size and ability to operate as a standalone public company.

Partnering Transaction
NYSE listing rules require that our partnering transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our partnering transaction. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our partnering transaction, although there is no assurance that will be the case.
We anticipate structuring our partnering transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our partnering transaction such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target, our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction may collectively own a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-business combination company, depending on, among other things, valuations ascribed to the target and us in our partnering transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our partnering transaction or our sponsor could convert some or all of its Series B common stock into Series A common stock. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock or other changes to our capital structure, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction (including our sponsor) could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction and therefore a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-transaction company. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests


  14
Table of Contents
or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our partnering transaction involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.
Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our partnering transaction.
Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Our executive offices are located at 2503 S. Hanley Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63144 and our telephone number is (314) 644-7600. Upon completion of this offering, our corporate website address will be                 .

The Offering
In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the identity of our sponsor and the experience of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company and the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section below entitled “Risk Factors” in this prospectus.
  Securities offered
40,000,000 units (or 46,000,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), at $10.00 per unit, each unit consisting of:

one share of Series A common stock; and
    •  
one-fifth of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock.

  Trading commencement and separation of Series A common stock and warrants
The units will begin trading on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Series A common stock and warrants constituting the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such date is not a business day, the following business day), unless Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the shares of Series A common stock and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of Series A common stock and warrants. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you are separating a multiple of five units, the number of warrants issuable to you upon separation of the units will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants.
    Additionally, the units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded after completion of our partnering transaction.
  Separate trading of the Series A common stock and warrants is prohibited until we have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K
In no event will the Series A common stock and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K,

(2) 
Consists solely of founder shares and includes up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 founder shares that are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.
(3) 
Includes 40,000,000 public shares, 10,000,000 founder shares and 1,200,000 private placement shares. No shares of Series B common stock or Series C common stock will be issued or outstanding immediately after the completion of this offering.

Founder shares are classified as shares of Series F common stock. Shares of Series F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Series B common stock at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, as described below adjacent to the caption “Founder shares conversion.” Prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock. No shares of Series B common stock or Series C common stock will be issued or outstanding immediately after the completion of this offering.

Exercisability
Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Series A common stock, subject to adjustment as provided herein, and only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade.
    We structured each unit to contain one-fifth of one warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable for one share of Series A common stock, as compared to units issued by some other similar blank check companies which contain whole warrants exercisable for one whole share, in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of our partnering transaction as compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses.
  Exercise price
$11.50 per share of Series A common stock, subject to adjustment as described herein.
    In addition, if (x) we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities, excluding forward purchase units, for capital raising purposes in connection with the consummation of our partnering transaction at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our sponsor or Post or its other subsidiaries, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor or Post or its other subsidiaries, as applicable) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances, excluding the forward purchase units, represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our partnering transaction on the date of the completion of our partnering transaction (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our Series A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our partnering transaction (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under “Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.
  Exercise period
The warrants will become exercisable on the later of:
    •  
30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction; and
    •  
12 months from the closing of this offering;


  18
Table of Contents
  provided in each case that we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or we permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement).
    We are not registering the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the consummation of our partnering transaction, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC, and within 60 business days following our partnering transaction to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Series A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed; provided that, if our Series A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
    The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of our partnering transaction or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the trust account.
  Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00
Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):
    •  
in whole and not in part;
    •  
at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
    •  
upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, which we refer to as the 30-day redemption period; and
    •  
if, and only if, the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted


  19
Table of Contents
  for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
    We will not redeem the warrants for cash unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
    If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis,” our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Series A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Series A common stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Series A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” of our Series A common stock (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361 shares of Series A common stock per warrant (subject to adjustment). See “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants” for additional information.
    The “fair market value” of our Series A common stock for this purpose shall mean the volume weighted average price of our Series A common stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. We will provide our warrant holders with the final fair market value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.
  Forward Purchase Agreement
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to


  20
Table of Contents
  which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, consisting of one forward purchase share and one-fifth of one forward purchase warrant, for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units.
    The forward purchase shares will be subject to registration rights. The forward purchase warrants will generally be identical to the term of the the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in this offering.
  Election and removal of directors; voting rights
Prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, only holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to vote on the election of directors. Holders of our Series A common stock and holders of our Series B common stock, if any, will not be entitled to vote on the election of directors during such time. In addition, prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock may remove members of our board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock. On any vote to approve our partnering transaction or any other matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction other than the matters addressed above in this paragraph, holders of our Series A common stock, holders of our Series B common stock, if any, and holders of our Series F common stock will generally vote together as a single class, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of our common stock entitling the holder to one vote.
    Following our partnering transaction, holders of our Series A common stock and holders of our Series B common stock will generally vote together as a single class on matters presented for a stockholder vote, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of Series A common stock entitling


  21
Table of Contents
  the holder to one vote per share and each share of Series B common stock entitling the holder to ten votes per share. Holders of our Series C common stock will not be entitled to any voting powers, except as (and then only to the extent) otherwise required by Delaware law.
  Founder shares
In January 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,500,000 shares of Series F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, with a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the completion of this offering. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by our sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering. Up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 founder shares are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.
    The founder shares are identical to the shares of Series A common stock included in the units being sold in this offering, except that:
    •  
prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of the Series F common stock have the right to vote on the election of directors and only holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock may remove members of our board of directors for any reason. Such rights as provided by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock;
    •  
on any vote to approve our partnering transaction or any other matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction other than the matters set forth in the previous two bullets, holders of our Series A common stock, holders of our Series B common stock, if any, and holders of our Series F common stock will generally vote together as a single class, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of our common stock entitling the holder to one vote;

following our partnering transaction, holders of our Series A common stock and holders of our Series B common stock will generally vote together as a single class on matters presented for a stockholder vote, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of Series A common stock entitling the holder to one vote per share and each share of Series B common stock entitling the holder to ten votes per share;
    •  
the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below;
    •  
our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive: (1) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction; (2) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any extended time that we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) as a result of a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (an “Extension Period”) (although our sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame). If we submit our partnering transaction to our public stockholders for a vote, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree to vote all shares of our common stock held by them in favor of our partnering transaction. As a result, in addition to our sponsor’s founder shares and private placement shares, we would need 14,400,001, or 36.0% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), or 1,600,001, or 4.00% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), of the 40,000,000 public shares sold in this

shares of our Series F common stock are automatically convertible into shares of our Series B common stock at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, as described in more detail below, and, prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock; and
    •  
the holders of founder shares are entitled to registration rights.
  Transfer restrictions on founder shares and private placement units
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree not to transfer, assign or sell (i) any founder shares held by them until the earlier to occur of: (1) one year after the completion of our partnering transaction; and (2) subsequent to our partnering transaction, (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our partnering transaction, or (ii) any of their private placement units, private placement shares, private placement warrants and Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion or exercise thereof until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction, subject to certain exceptions described herein under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units.” Any permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units” would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements as our sponsor with respect to any founder shares, private placement units, private placement shares, private placement warrants and shares of Series A common stock issued upon conversion or exercise thereof. We refer to such transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the lock-up.
  Founder shares conversion
We have 11,500,000 shares of Series F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding. Shares of Series F common stock will automatically convert into shares of Series B common stock at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis.
    Prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock.

Private placement units
Our sponsor has committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 1,200,000 private placement units (or 1,320,000 private placement units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), at a price of $10.00 per unit in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of this offering for an aggregate purchase price of $12,000,000 (or $13,200,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). The private placement units are identical to the units sold in this offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in this prospectus. If we do not consummate a partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering, the proceeds from the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the private placement units (and the underlying securities) will expire worthless. The private placement warrants included in the private placement units will be non-redeemable by us (except as set forth under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants for shares of Series A common stock when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00”) and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees (see “Description of Securities — Warrants — Private Placement Warrants”). If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than our sponsor or its permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering.
  Cashless exercise of private placement warrants
If holders of private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, except as described under “Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00,” they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of Series A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Series A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Sponsor fair market value” (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Sponsor fair market value. The “Sponsor fair market value” shall mean the average reported closing price of the shares of Series A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination. If they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We expect to have policies in place that restrict insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods.

Transfer restrictions on private placement warrants
The private placement warrants (including the Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction, except as described below under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units.”
  Proceeds to be held in trust account
NYSE listing rules provide that at least 80% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement units be deposited in a trust account. Of the net proceeds we will receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement units described in this prospectus, $400.0 million ($10.00 per unit), or $460.0 million ($10.00 per unit) if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full (including $14,000,000 (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions), will be deposited into a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $1,500,000 will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries.
    Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
  Anticipated expenses and funding sources
Unless and until we complete our partnering transaction, no proceeds held in the trust account will be available for our use, except the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes or to redeem our public shares in connection with an amendment to our amended and


  26
Table of Contents
  restated certificate of incorporation, as described above. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Based upon current interest rates, we expect the trust account to generate approximately $400,000 of interest annually (assuming an interest rate of 0.1% per year). Unless and until we complete our partnering transaction, we may pay our expenses only from:
    •  
the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units not held in the trust account, which will be approximately $2,500,000 in working capital after the payment of approximately $1,500,000 in expenses relating to this offering; and
    •  
any loans or additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or Post or any of its subsidiaries or other third parties, although they are under no obligation or other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us, and provided that any such loans will not have any claim on the proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon completion of our partnering transaction. If we complete our partnering transaction, we expect to repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our partnering transaction does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units issued to our sponsor.
  Conditions to completing our partnering transaction
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our partnering transaction. NYSE listing rules require that our partnering transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our partnering transaction. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our partnering transaction, although there is no assurance that will be the case.
    If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with


  27
Table of Contents
  respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will complete our partnering transaction only if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target, our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction may collectively own a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our partnering transaction. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test; provided that in the event that our partnering transaction involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
  Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities by our sponsor, insiders and the related companies
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies and their directors, officers and advisors may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market, either prior to or following the completion of our partnering transaction, although they are under no obligation or other duty to do so. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase, or any restriction on the price that they may pay. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our partnering transaction. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our partnering transaction, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies and their directors, officers and advisors may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our partnering transaction or not redeem their public shares. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such persons


  28
Table of Contents
  will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. See “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities” for a description of how such persons will determine from which stockholders to enter into transactions with.
    We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. Our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies and their directors, officers and advisors will be restricted from making purchases if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
    We expect that any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used in such transactions prior to completion of our partnering transaction.
    The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the partnering transaction and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the partnering transaction, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our partnering transaction or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the consummation of our partnering transaction, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our partnering transaction that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Series A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
  Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our partnering transaction
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our partnering transaction at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our


  29
Table of Contents
  partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our partnering transaction with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction.
  Manner of conducting redemptions
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our partnering transaction either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. Except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
    If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
    •  
conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
    •  
file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our partnering transaction which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the partnering transaction and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.


  30
Table of Contents
  Upon the public announcement of our partnering transaction, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Series A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
    In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our partnering transaction until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our partnering transaction. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such partnering transaction, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).
    If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will:
    •  
conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
    •  
file proxy materials with the SEC.
    We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.
    If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, holders of our common stock will vote together as a single class with each share entitling the holder to one vote and we will complete our partnering transaction only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination, subject to any other vote required by applicable law. A


  31
Table of Contents
  quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares of common stock held by our sponsor, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and they have agreed to vote our common stock held by them in favor of our partnering transaction. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our partnering transaction, our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) entitled to vote thereon. As a result, in addition to our sponsor’s founder shares and private placement shares, we would need 14,400,001, or 36.0% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), or 1,600,001, or 4.00% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), of the 40,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a partnering transaction in order to have such partnering transaction approved. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements may make it more likely that we will consummate our partnering transaction. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction.
    Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our partnering transaction. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).
  Tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their


  32
Table of Contents
  shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve our partnering transaction in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, rather than simply voting against the partnering transaction. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares
  Limitation on redemption rights of stockholders holding more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering if we hold a stockholder vote
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our sponsor to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our partnering transaction, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering) for or against our partnering transaction.

Redemption rights in connection with proposed amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain charter provisions. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions (other than amendments relating to the appointment or removal of directors prior to our partnering transaction, which require the approval of holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock) related to pre-partnering transaction activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock, subject to applicable law or stock exchange rule, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our sponsor, who will beneficially own 20% of our outstanding common stock upon the closing of this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units and assuming our sponsor does not purchase any units in this offering), may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they may choose. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with (x) amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above and (y) the completion of our


  34
Table of Contents
  partnering transaction. Any permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants” would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements as our sponsor with respect to any founder shares.
  Release of funds in trust account on consummation of our partnering transaction
On the completion of our partnering transaction, all amounts held in the trust account will be disbursed directly by the trustee or released to us to pay amounts due to any public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights as described above under “Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our partnering transaction,” to pay the underwriters their deferred underwriting commissions, to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of our partnering transaction and to pay other expenses associated with our partnering transaction. If our partnering transaction is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our partnering transaction or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our partnering transaction, to fund the purchase of other businesses, for share repurchases or for working capital.
  Redemption of public shares and distribution and liquidation if no partnering transaction
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree that we will have only 24 months from the closing of this offering to complete our partnering transaction (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event). If we have not completed our partnering transaction within such 24-month period (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law


  35
Table of Contents
  to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within such 24-month period (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event).
    Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period (although our sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame). The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares.
    Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Series A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.
  Limited payments to insiders
There will be no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by us to our sponsor, Post or its other subsidiaries, or their officers or directors, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction, other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units


  36
Table of Contents
  held in the trust account prior to the completion of our partnering transaction:
    •  
repayment of an aggregate of up to $300,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;
    •  
payment to certain subsidiaries of Post of a total of $40,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services;
    •  
payments of fees in cash to each of our non-employee directors for service on our board of directors in the amounts of $50,000 on each of the closing of this offering, the one-year anniversary of the closing of this offering, and the earlier of (x) the two-year anniversary of the closing of this offering and (y) the closing of our partnering transaction;
    •  
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing a partnering transaction; and
    •  
repayment of loans which may be made by our sponsor or Post or its other subsidiaries or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units.
    These payments may be funded using the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, in each case to the extent not held in the trust account or, upon the consummation of the partnering transaction, from any amounts remaining from the proceeds of the trust account released to us in connection therewith.
    Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or Post or its other subsidiaries.
  Audit committee
We will establish and maintain an audit committee. Among its responsibilities, the audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates and monitor compliance with the other terms relating to this offering. If any noncompliance is identified, then the audit committee will be charged with the responsibility to promptly take all action necessary to rectify such noncompliance or otherwise to cause compliance with the terms of this offering. See “Management — Committees of the Board of Directors — Audit Committee.”

Table of Contents
Conflicts of interest
As described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a partnering transaction opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of Post, our sponsor or any of our directors and officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their business combinations. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity. Additionally, none of Post, our sponsor or any other entity currently has any obligation or duty to provide us with any potential partnering transaction opportunity.
    For more information, including a list of our executive officers and directors and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers and the company, see “Management —Conflicts of Interest.”
    We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our partnering transaction.
  Indemnity
Our sponsor will agree that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; and (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.


  38
Table of Contents
  Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor, which is a newly formed entity, has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our partnering transaction and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our partnering transaction, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
Risks
We are a newly incorporated company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our partnering transaction, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings differ from this offering, see “Proposed Business — Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.” You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this prospectus.

There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following risks, uncertainties and other factors:

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Relating to Our Search for, and Consummation of or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination
Our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed partnering transaction, which means we may complete our partnering transaction even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.
We may not hold a stockholder vote to approve our partnering transaction unless the business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons. For example, the NYSE rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination. However, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction. Accordingly, we may consummate our partnering transaction even if holders of a majority of our outstanding public shares, or if holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote, do not approve of the business combination we consummate. See “Proposed Business — Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Partnering Transaction” for additional information.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree to vote in favor of such partnering transaction, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote our common stock held by them in favor of our partnering transaction. As a result, in addition to our sponsor’s founder shares and private placement shares, we would need 14,400,001, or 36.0% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), or 1,600,001, or 4.00% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), of the 40,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a partnering transaction in order to have such partnering transaction approved. We expect that our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) at the time of any such stockholder vote. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if our sponsor agreed to vote its founder shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders. In addition, Post and our sponsor reserve the right but are not required to provide incremental funding to us in connection with our partnering transaction by purchasing additional shares of Series B common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, which shares will also be sold in a private placement substantially concurrently with the consummation of our partnering transaction.

In evaluating a prospective target business for our partnering transaction, our management will rely on the availability of all of the funds from the sale of the forward purchase units to be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the partnering transaction. If the sale of some or all of the forward purchase units fails to close, for any reason, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our partnering transaction.
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units for an aggregate purchase price of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, fewer than 10,000,000 forward purchase units may be purchased.
Our sponsor’s obligation to purchase the forward purchase units will be subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including that our partnering transaction must be consummated substantially concurrently with the purchase of the forward purchase units. If the sale of the forward purchase units does not close for any reason, including by reason of the failure to fund the purchase price, for example, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our partnering transaction.
Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of such business combination.
At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Additionally, since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination. Accordingly, if we do not seek stockholder approval, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our partnering transaction.
The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.
We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with a business combination and such amount of deferred underwriting discount is not available for us to use as consideration in a partnering transaction. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our partnering transaction. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the
  44
Table of Contents
same target). Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. If we are able to consummate a partnering transaction, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming stockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.
The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.
At the time we enter into an agreement for our partnering transaction, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights and, therefore, we will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our partnering transaction agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.
The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our partnering transaction would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock.
If our partnering transaction agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our partnering transaction would be unsuccessful increases. If our partnering transaction is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market.
The requirement that we complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our partnering transaction on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.
Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event). Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our partnering transaction with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our partnering transaction with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the end of the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our partnering transaction on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.

We may not be able to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless.
Our sponsor will agree that we must complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event). We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our partnering transaction within such time period. Our ability to complete our partnering transaction may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein, including as a result of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of infectious diseases. For example, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally and, while the extent of the impact of the outbreak on us will depend on future developments, it could limit our ability to complete our partnering transaction, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) may negatively impact businesses we may seek to acquire. It may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to the market for our securities and cross-border transactions.
If we have not completed our partnering transaction within such time period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such case, our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per share, or less than $10.00 per share, on the redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein.
Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by COVID-19 outbreak and other events and the status of debt and equity markets.
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced, which has and is continuing to spread throughout parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected, and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) could adversely affect, economies and financial markets worldwide, business operations and the conduct of commerce generally, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be, or may already have been, materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel or limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors, or the target company’s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a
  46
Table of Contents
transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.
In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases), including as a result of increased market volatility and decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Finally, the outbreak of COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to the market for our securities and cross border transactions.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies or their directors, officers or advisors may enter into certain transactions, including purchasing shares or warrants from the public, which may influence the outcome of our proposed business combination and reduce the public “float” of our securities.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies or their directors, officers or advisors may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our partnering transaction, although they are under no obligation or other duty to do so. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such public stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies or their directors, officers or advisors purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling public stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our partnering transaction. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our partnering transaction, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies or their directors, officers or advisors may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our partnering transaction or not redeem their public shares. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. See “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities” for a description of how such persons will determine from which stockholders to enter into transactions with. The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the partnering transaction and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the partnering transaction, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our partnering transaction or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the consummation of our partnering transaction, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our partnering transaction that may not otherwise have been possible.
  47
Table of Contents
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Series A common stock or warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.
We will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the tender offer documents or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. For example, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the partnering transaction in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. See “Proposed Business — Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights.”
You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.
Since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units are intended to be used to complete a partnering transaction with a business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the U.S. securities laws. However, because we will have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful completion of this offering and the sale of the private placement units and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet of our company demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our partnering transaction than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if this offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of our partnering transaction. For a more detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419, see “Proposed Business —  Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.”
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Series A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Series A common stock.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not restrict our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our partnering transaction. Your inability
  48
Table of Contents
to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our partnering transaction and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our partnering transaction. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.
Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our partnering transaction. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on our redemption of their stock, and our warrants will expire worthless.
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our partnering transaction and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing a business combination. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein.
If the funds not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 24 months following the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), we may be unable to complete our partnering transaction.
The funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 24 months following the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), assuming that our partnering transaction is not completed during that time. We expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. Management’s plans to address this need for capital through this offering and potential loans from certain entities are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” However, those entities, including Post, are not obligated to make loans to us in the future, and we may not be able to raise additional financing from other parties necessary to fund our expenses. Any such event in the future may negatively impact the analysis regarding our ability to continue as a going concern at such time. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein.
  49
Table of Contents
If the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units not being held in the trust account are insufficient, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our partnering transaction and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search, to pay our taxes and to complete our partnering transaction. If we are unable to obtain such loans, we may be unable to complete our partnering transaction.
Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, only approximately $2,500,000 will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,500,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,500,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries is under any obligation or other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us in such circumstances. Any such loans may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our partnering transaction. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In such case, our public stockholders may receive only $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein. Subsequent to our completion of our partnering transaction, we may be required to subsequently take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.
Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a stockholder or warrant holder following our partnering transaction could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.
If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.
Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if
  50
Table of Contents
they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management team will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our acquisition proposal less attractive to them and, to the extent prospective target businesses refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential target businesses that we might pursue.
Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not completed our partnering transaction within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our partnering transaction, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors.
Our sponsor will agree that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; and (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor, which is a newly formed entity, has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our partnering transaction and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our partnering transaction, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
Our independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; and (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest
  51
Table of Contents
which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.
The securities in which we invest the funds held in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.
The net proceeds of this offering and certain proceeds from the sale of the private placement units, in the amount of $400,000,000, will be held in the trust account and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we do not complete our partnering transaction within the allotted time frame or make certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our public stockholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income, net of taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, $100,000 of interest). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.
If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages.
If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with any liquidation may be reduced.
If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the
  52
Table of Contents
trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our public stockholders in connection with any liquidation would be reduced.
If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our partnering transaction.
If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:
    •  
restrictions on the nature of our investments; and
    •  
restrictions on the issuance of securities;
each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our partnering transaction.
In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:
    •  
registration as an investment company with the SEC;
    •  
adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and
    •  
reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and compliance with other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to.
In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resell or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.
We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. This offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our primary business objective, which is a business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (iii) absent a business combination, our return of the funds
  53
Table of Contents
held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate our partnering transaction. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein.
Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our partnering transaction, and results of operations.
We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our partnering transaction, and results of operations.
If we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months of the closing of this offering or during any subsequent Extension Period, our public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond such 24 months before redemption from our trust account.
If we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public stockholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, as further described herein. Any redemption of public stockholders from the trust account shall be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to windup, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public stockholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”). In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond the initial 24 months (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) before the redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate our partnering transaction or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and then only in cases where investors have properly sought to redeem their shares of Series A common stock. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public stockholders be entitled to distributions if we have not completed our partnering transaction within the required time period or do not amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior thereto.
Our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to
  54
Table of Contents
our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month (or 27th month following an agreement in principle event) from the closing of this offering (or the end of any Extension Period) in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures.
Because we do not intend to comply with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, consultants, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction within the required time period is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.
We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the completion of our partnering transaction and you will not be entitled to any of the corporate protections provided by such a meeting.
We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate our partnering transaction (unless required by NYSE) and thus may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting of stockholders be held for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with a company’s bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to our completion of our partnering transaction, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL. Until we hold an annual meeting of stockholders, public stockholders may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management.
The grant of registration rights to our sponsor and its permitted transferees may make it more difficult to complete our partnering transaction, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Series A common stock.
Pursuant to an investor rights agreement and a forward purchase agreement to be entered into on or prior to the closing of this offering, at or after the time of our partnering transaction, our sponsor and/or its permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the private placement shares, the private
  55
Table of Contents
placement warrants, the forward purchase shares, the forward purchase warrants, shares and warrants underlying the units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and shares of Series A common stock issuable upon (1) conversion of the founder shares, (2) exercise of the private placement units, (3) conversion of the forward purchase shares, (4) exercise of the forward purchase units and forward purchase warrants and (5) exercise of private placement warrants underlying the private placement units issued upon conversion of working capital loans (if any). We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series A common stock.
The existence of the registration rights may make our partnering transaction more costly or difficult to complete. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Series A common stock that is expected when the common stock owned by our sponsor or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants are registered for resale or warrants issued in connection with working capital loans.
Because we are neither limited to evaluating target businesses in a particular industry, sector or geographic area nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our partnering transaction, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations.
Although we expect to focus on the consumer packaged goods industry, we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in any industry, sector or geographic area. However, we will not, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our partnering transaction solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our partnering transaction, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a stockholder or warrant holder following our partnering transaction could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.
We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors that may be outside of our management team’s areas of expertise.
We will consider a business combination outside of our management team’s areas of expertise if such business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management team’s expertise, our management team’s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus regarding the areas of our management team’s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors relevant to such acquisition. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain a
  56
Table of Contents
stockholder or warrant holder following our partnering transaction could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.
Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our partnering transaction with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our partnering transaction may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.
Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our partnering transaction will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our partnering transaction with a target that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our partnering transaction if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
We may seek acquisition opportunities with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings, which could subject us to volatile revenues or earnings, intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel.
To the extent we complete our partnering transaction with an early stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include investing in a business without a proven business model and with limited historical financial data, volatile revenues or earnings, intense competition and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.
As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our partnering transaction and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate a partnering transaction.
In recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into a partnering transaction, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies preparing for an initial public offering, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available to consummate a partnering transaction.
In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into a partnering transaction with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns,
  57
Table of Contents
geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate a partnering transaction, and may result in our inability to consummate a partnering transaction on terms favorable to our investors altogether.
We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm regarding fairness, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another accounting, valuation or appraisal firm that such partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our partnering transaction.
We may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to complete our partnering transaction or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our partnering transaction. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of up to 500,000,000 shares of Series A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 80,000,000 shares of Series B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 40,000,000 shares of Series C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 40,000,000 shares of Series F common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Immediately after this offering, there will be 450,560,000 and 30,000,000 (assuming in each case, that the underwriters have not exercised their over-allotment option) authorized but unissued shares of Series A and Series F common stock available, respectively, for issuance, which amount takes into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants but not upon the issuance of Series B common stock upon the conversion of the Series F common stock or the issuance of Series A common stock upon the conversion of such Series B common stock or any securities issuable pursuant to the forward purchase agreement (including shares issuable upon exercise of forward purchase warrants). Shares of Series F common stock will automatically convert at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, into shares of Series B common stock on a one-for-one basis. Prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock. Immediately after this offering, there will be no shares of Series B common stock, Series C common stock or preferred stock outstanding.
We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in order to complete our partnering transaction or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our partnering transaction. We may also issue shares of Series A common stock in connection with the redemption of warrants as described in “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00.” However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that prior to our partnering transaction, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation on any partnering transaction. The issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock, including pursuant to the forward purchase agreement:
    •  
may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering;
    •  
may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
  58
Table of Contents
  •  
could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
    •  
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;
    •  
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Series A common stock and/or warrants; and
    •  
may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.
Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.
We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific partnering transaction, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our partnering transaction for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors herein.
Our company has overlapping directors and management with multiple entities, each of which may lead to conflicting interests. Additionally, certain of our officers and directors have, and in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities which may lead to additional conflicting interests.
All of our officers also serve as executive officers of one or more of the related companies, and there are overlapping directors with such entities. Our officers and members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at any of the related companies have fiduciary duties to that company’s stockholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and one or more of the related companies to which they owe fiduciary duties.
As described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a partnering transaction opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of Post, our sponsor or any of our directors and officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their business combinations. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or
  59
Table of Contents
officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity. Additionally, none of Post, our sponsor or any other entity currently has any obligation or duty to provide us with any potential partnering transaction opportunity.
One or more of the related companies may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunities, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Post may be suitable for both us and for one or more other entities and may be directed to such entity rather than to us.
Post is a consumer packaged goods holding company operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, foodservice, food ingredient and convenient nutrition food categories. Post also participates in the private brand food category. Conflicts may arise from Post’s indirect ownership of our company, as well as from actions undertaken by any its subsidiaries. Additionally, Post may take commercial steps which may have an adverse effect on us, including with respect to any target we acquire in the partnering transaction.
Moreover, most of our directors and officers continue to own stock and options to purchase stock in one or more of the related companies. These ownership interests and/or such disparity could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and the related companies.
Furthermore, we may enter into transactions with one or more of the related companies. While any potential conflict that qualifies as a “related party transaction” (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer’s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director. See “— We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that may be owned by our sponsor or one or more of the related companies, or its or their officers or directors, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.”
We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors who must allocate their time among our business and other businesses. The departure of our executive officers or directors or conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our partnering transaction.
Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our partnering transaction. Our officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations, including our search for a partnering transaction, and these other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, nor do we have any employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of any of our directors or officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or officers could have a detrimental effect on us.
In addition, certain of our officers and directors are employed by or otherwise provide service to Post or other companies that may make investments in, or operate in, industries we may target for our partnering transaction. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our partnering transaction. For a complete discussion of our officers’ and directors’ other business affairs, see “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”

From time to time, we and members of our management team may be subject to legal proceedings, regulatory disputes, and governmental inquiries that could cause us to incur significant expenses, divert our management’s attention, and materially harm our financial condition.
From time to time, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, securities, tax, commercial disputes, and other matters that could adversely affect our financial condition. Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. Additionally, such litigation and regulatory proceedings require a great deal of financial resources and attention from us and our management team. Adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments, or penalties and fines, and could negatively affect our ability to identify and complete a partnering transaction and may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.
Members of our management team have been involved in a wide variety of businesses. Such involvement has, and may lead to, media coverage and public awareness. As a result, members of our management team and the related companies may from time to time be involved in civil disputes or governmental investigations unrelated to our business. Any such claims or investigations may be detrimental to our reputation and could negatively affect our ability to identify and complete a partnering transaction and may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.
Our officers, directors and security holders may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.
We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or any other entities from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a business that is owned by our sponsor or any of the related companies, or its or their officers or directors, or make the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor or any of the related companies, or its or their officers or directors, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.
In particular, the related companies have invested, and may in the future invest, in a broad array of industries, including the consumer packaged goods industry. As a result, there may be substantial overlap between companies that would be a suitable business combination for us and companies that would make an attractive target for such entities.
We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that may be owned by our sponsor or one or more of the related companies, or its or their officers or directors, which may raise potential conflicts of interest.
In light of the involvement of our sponsor, officers and directors with other businesses, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses owned by our sponsor or any of the related companies, or its or their officers or directors, or make the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor or any of the related companies, or its or their officers or directors. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our partnering transaction, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a future issuance to any such parties, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. Our officers and directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest.” Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor is not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our partnering transaction with any such entities, and we have not, nor has anyone on our
  61

behalf, engaged in substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any such entity or entities with respect to a partnering transaction with us. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any such entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such an entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in “Proposed Business — Effecting our Partnering Transaction — Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Partnering Transaction” and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. While we are not required to obtain an opinion regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses owned by the related companies, or any of their subsidiaries, or our sponsor, or its or their officers or directors, in the event we do not obtain such an opinion, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.
Since our sponsor will lose their entire investment in us if our partnering transaction is not completed (other than with respect to any public shares they may hold), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our partnering transaction.
In January 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, with a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per share, up to 1,500,000 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete a partnering transaction.
Our sponsor will commit, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 1,200,000 private placement units (or 1,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per unit ($12,000,000 in the aggregate or $13,200,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering.
Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own securities following this offering, including founder shares, and the personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing a partnering transaction and influencing the operation of the business following the partnering transaction. This risk may become more acute as the deadline for completing our partnering transaction nears.
We may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders’ investment in us.
Although we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following this offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our partnering transaction. We have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:
    •  
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a partnering transaction are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
    •  
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
  62
Table of Contents
  •  
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;
    •  
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;
    •  
our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
    •  
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
    •  
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
    •  
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and
    •  
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.
We may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units and forward purchase units, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.
The net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement units and the sale of the forward purchase units for a purchase price of $100,000,000 will provide us with $502,500,000 (or $562,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) that we may use to complete our partnering transaction (which includes $14,000,000, or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account and estimated post-IPO working capital expenses of $2,500,000, and excludes estimated offering expenses of $1,500,000).
We may effectuate our partnering transaction with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our partnering transaction with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our partnering transaction with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:
    •  
solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or
    •  
dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our partnering transaction.

Table of Contents
We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our partnering transaction and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our partnering transaction. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.
We may attempt to complete our partnering transaction with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.
In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our partnering transaction with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential partnering transaction on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.
We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our partnering transaction with which a substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our partnering transaction. As a result, we may be able to complete our partnering transaction even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor or any of the related companies. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).
The exercise price for the public warrants is higher than in some other blank check company offerings, and, accordingly, the warrants are more likely to expire worthless.
The exercise price of the public warrants is higher than in some other blank check companies. For example, historically, the exercise price of a warrant was often a fraction of the purchase price of the units in the initial public offering. The exercise price for our public warrants is $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments as provided herein. As a result, the warrants are less likely to ever be in the money and more likely to expire worthless.

In order to effectuate a partnering transaction, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or governing instruments, including our warrant agreement, in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our partnering transaction that some of our stockholders or warrant holders may not support.
In order to effectuate a partnering transaction, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds extended the time to consummate a partnering transaction and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate a partnering transaction in order to effectuate our partnering transaction.
Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-partnering transaction activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to facilitate the completion of a partnering transaction that some of our stockholders may not support.
Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company’s pre-partnering transaction activity, without approval by holders of a certain percentage of the company’s stockholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by holders holding between 90% and 100% of the company’s public shares. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions (other than amendments relating to the appointment or removal of directors prior to our partnering transaction, which require the approval of holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock) related to pre-partnering transaction activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Prior to our partnering transaction, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock is required to approve the election or removal of directors. Our sponsor, who will beneficially own 20% of our outstanding capital stock upon the closing of this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units and assuming our sponsor does not purchase any units in this offering), may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will govern our pre-partnering transaction behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete our partnering transaction with which you do not agree.
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, pursuant to a letter agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other
  65

provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Series A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in a letter agreement that we will enter into with our sponsor, executive officers and directors. Our public stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor for any breach of these agreements.
Certain agreements related to this offering may be amended without stockholder approval.
The underwriting agreement relating to this offering, the letter agreement between us and our sponsor, executive officers and directors, the investor rights agreement among us, our sponsor and Post, the forward purchase agreement between us and our sponsor, the services agreement between us and Post and the facilities sharing agreement among us, our sponsor and a subsidiary of Post, may be amended without stockholder approval. These agreements contain various provisions, including transfer restrictions on our founder shares held by our sponsor, that our public stockholders might deem to be material.
While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any amendment to any of these agreements prior to our partnering transaction, it may be possible that our board of directors, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to any such agreement in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction. Any such amendments would not require approval from our stockholders, may result in the completion of our partnering transaction that may not otherwise have been possible, and may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities.
We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our partnering transaction or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.
Although we believe that the net proceeds of this offering, the sale of the private placement units and forward purchase units will be sufficient to allow us to complete our partnering transaction, because we have not yet selected any target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units and forward purchase units prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our partnering transaction, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our partnering transaction or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our partnering transaction, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our partnering transaction, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our partnering transaction, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. Other than in connection with the forward purchase agreement, none of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our partnering transaction. If we are unable to complete our partnering transaction, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless.

Our sponsor controls the election of our board of directors and hold a substantial interest in us. Additionally, holders of our Series A common stock will have limited voting rights following our partnering transaction. As a result, the sponsor will elect all of our directors prior to our partnering transaction and may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.
Upon the closing of this offering, our sponsor will own 20% of the voting power of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units and assuming our sponsor does not purchase units in this offering). In addition, prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to appoint, elect and remove our board of directors. Holders of our public shares will have no right to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock. Additionally, following our partnering transaction, holders of our Series A common stock and holders of our Series B common stock will generally vote together as a single class on matters presented for a stockholder vote, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of Series A common stock entitling the holder to one vote per share and each share of Series B common stock entitling the holder to ten votes per share. As a result, you will not have any influence over the election of directors prior to our partnering transaction, and will have limited voting rights following our partnering transaction.
Our sponsor has no current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this prospectus, which may include participation in a private placement of securities or exercise of warrants. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Series A common stock. The forward purchase units will not be issued until the consummation of our partnering transaction and, accordingly, will not be included in any stockholder vote until such time. As a result of its substantial ownership in our company, our sponsor may exert a substantial influence on other actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of major corporate transactions.
Our warrants and founder shares of our sponsor may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Series A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our partnering transaction.
We will be issuing warrants to purchase 8,000,000 shares of our Series A common stock (or up to 9,200,000 shares of our Series A common stock if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), at a price of $11.50 per whole share (subject to adjustment as provided herein), as part of the units offered by this prospectus and, simultaneously with the closing of this offering, we will be issuing in a private placement an aggregate of 1,200,000 (or 1,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement units, which will have underlying warrants, each whole warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. In addition, if our sponsor, any of the related companies or certain of our officers and directors make any working capital loans, up to $2,500,000 of such loans may be converted into units, at the price of $10.000 per unit at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the private placement units. Any issuance of Series A common stock upon exercise of these units will increase the number of outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of any common stock we may issue to complete the business combination.
Furthermore, our sponsor currently holds 11,500,000 founder shares (up to 1,500,000 of which are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised). The founder shares are convertible into shares of Series B common stock on a one-for-one basis. The issuance of shares of Series B common stock upon exercise of these conversion rights and the voting rights related to our Series B common stock could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business.
  67
Table of Contents
Therefore, our units and founder shares may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.
The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in this offering except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees: (1) they will not be redeemable by us; (2) they (including the Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction, except as described herein under “Principal Stockholders—Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units”, (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4) the holders thereof (including with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights.
To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to effectuate our partnering transaction, including those underlying the forward purchase units, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of these warrants or conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of our common stock issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our public warrants, founder shares, private placement units and forward purchase units may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.
Because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous partnering transaction with some prospective target businesses.
The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame.
Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our partnering transaction, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our partnering transaction may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

Our independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.”
As of January 27, 2021, we had no cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of $20,000. Further, we expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. Management’s plans to address this need for capital through this offering are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our plans to raise capital and to consummate our partnering transaction may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to consummate this offering or our inability to continue as a going concern.
Risks Relating to the Post-Business Combination Company
If our management team pursues a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our partnering transaction, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such combination, and if we effect such partnering transaction, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.
If our management team pursues a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our partnering transaction, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our partnering transaction, conducting due diligence in a foreign market, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
If we effect our partnering transaction with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:
    •  
costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations and complying with commercial and legal requirements of overseas markets;
    •  
rules and regulations regarding currency redemption;
    •  
complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;
    •  
laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;
    •  
tariffs and trade barriers;
    •  
regulations related to customs and import/export matters;
    •  
longer payment cycles;
    •  
changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases;
    •  
tax consequences;
    •  
currency fluctuations and exchange controls;
    •  
rates of inflation;
    •  
challenges in collecting accounts receivable;
    •  
cultural and language differences;
    •  
employment regulations;
    •  
crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars;
  69
Table of Contents
  •  
deterioration of political relations with the United States;
    •  
obligatory military service by personnel; and
    •  
government appropriation of assets.
We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such business combination or, if we complete such business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our partnering transaction. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.
We may structure our partnering transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target, our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction (including our sponsor) may collectively own a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post business combination company, depending on, among other things, valuations ascribed to the target and us in our partnering transaction and any changes in our post business combination capital structure. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our partnering transaction or our sponsor could convert some or all of its Series B common stock into Series A common stock. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock or other changes in our capital structure, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction (including our sponsor) could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction, and therefore a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-transaction company. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.
If our management team, following our partnering transaction, is unfamiliar with U.S. securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.
Following our partnering transaction, any or all of our management team could resign from their positions as officers of the post-business combination company, and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination could remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with U.S. securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with U.S. securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues, which may adversely affect our operations.
The officers and directors of a prospective target business may resign upon the completion of our partnering transaction, which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.
The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our partnering transaction. The departure of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the
  70
Table of Contents
operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate’s key personnel upon the completion of our partnering transaction cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our partnering transaction, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place.
Risks Relating to our Securities
You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction, and then only in connection with those shares of Series A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In addition, if we have not completed a partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) for any reason, compliance with Delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our trust account. In that case, public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond the end of such period before they receive funds from our trust account. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.
We are not registering the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a “cashless basis” and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.
We are not registering the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the consummation of our partnering transaction, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC, and within 60 business days following our partnering transaction to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Series A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of shares of Series A common stock that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 shares of Series A common stock per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we
  71
Table of Contents
will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Series A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of Series A common stock included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants included as part of units sold in this offering. In such an instance, our sponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the shares of Series A common stock underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying shares of Series A common stock. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying shares of Series A common stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.
NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
We intend to apply to have our units listed on the NYSE on or promptly after the date of this prospectus and our Series A common stock and warrants listed on or promptly after their date of separation. Although after giving effect to this offering we expect to meet the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the NYSE listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on the NYSE prior to our partnering transaction. Additionally, in connection with our partnering transaction, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with NYSE’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE’s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For example, in order for our Series A common stock to be listed upon the consummation of our partnering transaction, among other things, we would be required to have at least 300 round lot holders at such time. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. The NYSE will also have discretionary authority to not approve our listing if it determines that the listing of the company to be acquired is against public policy at that time.
If NYSE delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:
    •  
a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;
    •  
reduced liquidity for our securities;
    •  
a determination that our Series A common stock is a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our Series A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;
  72
Table of Contents
  •  
a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and
    •  
a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.
The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because we expect that our units and eventually our Series A common stock and warrants will be listed on the NYSE, our units, Series A common stock and warrants will qualify as covered securities under such statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by special purpose acquisition companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.
Our sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000, or approximately $0.002 per share, and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our Series A common stock.
The difference between the public offering price per share (allocating all of the unit purchase price to the common stock and none to the warrant included in the unit) and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Series A common stock after this offering constitutes the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering. Our sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon the closing of this offering, and assuming no value is ascribed to the warrants included in the units, you and the other public stockholders will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately 96.1% (or $9.61 per share, assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share of $0.39 and the initial offering price of $10.00 per unit. This dilution would become exacerbated to the extent that public stockholders seek redemptions from the trust.
We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the warrants could be converted into cash or stock, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of our Series A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.
Our warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that (a) the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this prospectus, or defective provision or (ii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants and (b) all other modifications or amendments require the vote or written consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants; provided that any amendment that solely affects the terms of the private placement warrants or forward purchase warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement solely with respect to the private placement warrants or forward purchase warrants will also require at least 50% of the then outstanding private placement warrants or forward purchase warrants, respectively. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent
  73
Table of Contents
of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.
Our warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.
Our warrant agreement will provide that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state courts located in the State of Delaware and the federal courts in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.
This choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.
A provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate a partnering transaction.
Unlike some blank check companies, if
    (i)
we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities, excluding forward purchase units, for capital raising purposes in connection with the consummation of our partnering transaction at a Newly Issued Price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock,
    (ii)
the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances, excluding the forward purchase units, represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our partnering transaction on the date of the completion of our partnering transaction (net of redemptions), and
    (iii)
the Market Value is below $9.20 per share,
  74
Table of Contents
then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate a partnering transaction with a target business.
We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.
We have the ability to redeem outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant if, among other things, the last reported sales price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the public warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to: (1) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so; (2) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants; or (3) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.
None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees.
Because each unit contains one-fifth of one redeemable warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.
Each unit contains one-fifth of one redeemable warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. This is different from some other offerings similar to ours whose units include one share of Series A common stock and one whole warrant to purchase one share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for a fifth of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.
The determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry. You may have less assurance, therefore, that the offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than you would have in a typical offering of an operating company.
Prior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the underwriters. In determining the size of this offering, management held customary organizational meetings with representatives of the underwriters with respect to the state of capital markets, generally, and the amount the underwriters believed
  75
Table of Contents
they reasonably could raise on our behalf. Factors considered in determining the size of this offering, prices and terms of the units, including the Series A common stock and warrants underlying the units, include:
    •  
the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies;
    •  
prior offerings of those companies;
    •  
our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values;
    •  
a review of debt to equity ratios in leveraged transactions;
    •  
our capital structure;
    •  
an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying suitable business combination opportunities;
    •  
general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering; and
    •  
other factors as were deemed relevant.
Although these factors were considered, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results.
Since only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, upon the listing of our shares on the NYSE, the NYSE may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.
After completion of this offering, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors until our partnering transaction. As a result, NYSE may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:
    •  
we have a board that includes a majority of “independent directors,” as defined under the rules of NYSE; and
    •  
we have a corporate governance and compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.
We do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of NYSE, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.
Our governance structure and the adoption of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may negatively affect the decision by certain institutional investors to purchase or hold shares of our Series A common stock.
The holding of low-voting stock, such as our Series A common stock, or if it is issued in the future, our non-voting Series C common stock, may not be permitted by the investment policies of certain institutional investors or may be less attractive to the portfolio managers of certain institutional investors. In addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly public
  76
Table of Contents
companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Our multi-class capital structure may make us ineligible for inclusion in any of these and certain other indices following our partnering transaction, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices would not invest in our stock. These policies may depress our valuation compared to those of other similar companies that are included in such indices.
There is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.
There is currently no market for our securities. Stockholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision. Following this offering, the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases). Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.
Holders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.
Principles of Delaware law and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with our company or our company’s directors, officers or employees.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, another state court within the State of Delaware or, if no state court in Delaware has subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district courts of the United States of America) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) to bring (1) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought or purportedly brought on behalf of our company, (2) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, stockholder, officer, employee or agent of our company to our company or our stockholders, or any claim of
  77
Table of Contents
aiding and abetting such breach, (3) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation, or remedy under, any provision of the DGCL or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws, (5) any action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer of our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, (6) any action, suit, or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, or (7) any action, suit or proceeding asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL; in all cases, subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph will not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise arising under federal securities laws, for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum.
Section 22 of the Securities Act, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a “foreign action”) in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state courts located within the State of Delaware and the federal courts in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder.
Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees and may result in additional costs for a stockholder seeking to bring a claim. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. While we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce this forum selection clause is low, if a court were to determine the forum selection clause to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition and result in a diversion of time and resources of our management team and board of directors.
We will adopt certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that we intend to retain following the partnering transaction that may make difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.
We will adopt certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that we intend to retain following the partnering transaction that may discourage, delay or
  78
Table of Contents
prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:
    •  
authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock, including Series A common stock that entitles the holder to one vote per share, Series B common stock that entitles the holders to initially one vote per share or, following our partnering transaction, ten votes per share, Series C common stock that except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holder to no voting rights and a Series F common stock that, prior to the completion of our partnering transaction will be the only shares entitled to vote on the election of directors;
    •  
from and after our partnering transaction, classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;
    •  
limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
    •  
establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
    •  
requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our total voting power of our outstanding capital stock or approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our restated charter (except for any stockholder approval in connection with our partnering transaction);
    •  
the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of our company;
    •  
following the completion of our partnering transaction, prohibiting stockholders from filling vacancies on our board of directors, which will only be able to be filled by our board of directors;
    •  
following the completion of our partnering transaction, providing that any or all of our directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
Together these provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. These provisions may also affect a target’s desire to enter into a partnering transaction with us.
General Risk Factors
We are a newly incorporated company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
We are a newly incorporated company with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through this offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our partnering transaction with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our partnering transaction. If we fail to complete our partnering transaction, we will never generate any operating revenues.

Past performance by Post and members of our management team may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.
Information regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, our management team or Post is presented for informational purposes only. Past experience and performance, including related to acquisitions, of our management team or Post is not a guarantee either: (1) that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our partnering transaction; or (2) of any results with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record or performance of Post or any members of our management team or any related investment’s performance as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. An investment in us is not an investment in Post.
We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.
We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of any second fiscal quarter of a fiscal year, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the end of such fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
We will depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third

parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.
An investment in this offering may result in uncertain or adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.
An investment in this offering may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax consequences. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address instruments similar to the units we are issuing in this offering, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the share of Series A common stock and the one-fifth of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of our Series A common stock included in each Unit could be challenged by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, or the courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of warrants included in the units we are issuing in this offering are unclear under current law, and the adjustment to the exercise price and/or redemption price of the warrants could give rise to dividend income to investors without a corresponding payment of cash. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our shares of common stock suspend the running of a U.S. Holder’s holding period for purposes of determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered a “qualified dividend” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section of this prospectus titled “United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to an investment in our securities. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these and other tax consequences applicable to their specific circumstances when purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities.

A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of January 27, 2021, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor. Subsequent to January 27, 2021, we borrowed approximately $120,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
  82
Table of Contents
  will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account. These expenses are estimates only. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.
(3)
The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our partnering transaction, $14,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters or third parties as described below from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds, less amounts used to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our partnering transaction occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our partnering transaction, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
(4)
Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed estimates.
(5)
These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account to pay our taxes. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately $400,000 to be available to us annually from interest earned on the funds held in the trust account; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.1% per annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our partnering transaction, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our partnering transaction does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per units at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
NYSE listing rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement units be deposited in a trust account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, $400,000,000 (or $460,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $14,000,000 (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be placed in a U.S.-based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money
  83
Table of Contents
market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $400,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.1% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any. The funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.
The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our partnering transaction. If our partnering transaction is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our partnering transaction or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our partnering transaction, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our partnering transaction.
Amounts not held in trust are intended to cover estimated costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. In order to limit expenses, while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. We may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, but such persons are not under any obligation or other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us.
We will enter into a services agreement and facilities sharing agreement pursuant to which we will pay Post and certain of its subsidiaries a total of $40,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our partnering transaction or any liquidation, we may cease paying some or all of these monthly fees.
Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of January 27, 2021, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor. Subsequent to January 27, 2021, we borrowed approximately $120,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2021 and the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.
In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our partnering transaction, we may repay such loaned amounts out of
  84
Table of Contents
the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our partnering transaction does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, consisting of one forward purchase shares and one-fifth of one forward purchase warrant, for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers or advisors or any of the related companies or their directors, officers or advisors may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our partnering transaction. See “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities” for a description of how such persons will determine from which stockholders to seek to acquire shares. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our partnering transaction. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If such persons engage in such transactions, they will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions and the agreement for our partnering transaction may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction and then, only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
  85
Table of Contents
allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any rights to proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants.
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive: (1) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction; (2) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any extended time that we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) during an Extension Period (although our sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame).

DIVIDEND POLICY
We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our partnering transaction. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our partnering transaction. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our partnering transaction will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of this offering, in which case we will effect a stock dividend or other appropriate mechanism with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our partnering transaction, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

DILUTION
The difference between the public offering price per share of Series A common stock, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement units, and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Series A common stock after this offering constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement units, which would cause the actual dilution to the public stockholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Series A common stock which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of outstanding shares of our Series A common stock.
At January 27, 2021, our net tangible book value was negative $20,000 or approximately $(0.00) per share of Series F common stock. After giving effect to the sale of 40,000,000 shares of Series A common stock included in the units we are offering by this prospectus, the sale of the private placement units and the deduction of underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at January 27, 2021 would have been $5,000,010 or $0.39 per share, representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 38,351,999 shares of Series A common stock that may be redeemed for cash and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) of $0.39 per share to our sponsor as of the date of this prospectus and an immediate dilution of $9.61 per share or 96.1% to our public stockholders not exercising their redemption rights. The dilution to new investors if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full would be an immediate dilution of $9.66 per share or 96.6%
The following table illustrates the dilution to the public stockholders on a per share basis, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units or the private placement units:

For purposes of presentation, we have reduced our pro forma net tangible book value after this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) by $383,519,990 because holders of up to approximately 95.9% of our public shares may redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account at a per-share redemption price equal to the amount in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of shares of Series A common stock sold in this offering.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of January 27, 2021, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor. Subsequent to January 27, 2021, we borrowed approximately $120,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.

Assumes the full forfeiture of an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares that are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised. The proceeds of the sale of such shares will not be deposited into the trust account, the shares will not be eligible for redemption from the trust account nor will they be eligible to vote upon the partnering transaction.
(3)
Upon the completion of our partnering transaction, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), subject to the limitations described herein whereby our net tangible assets will be maintained at a minimum of $5,000,001 and any limitations (including, but not limited to, cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. The value of Series A common stock that may be redeemed is equal to

Table of Contents
  $10.00 per share (which is the assumed redemption price) multiplied by 38,351,999 shares of Series A common stock, which is the maximum number of shares of Series A common stock that may be redeemed for a $10.00 purchase price per share and still maintain at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets.

Actual share amount is prior to any forfeiture of founder shares by our sponsor. The “as adjusted” share amount assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option and the forfeiture of 1,500,000 founder shares by our sponsor.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
We are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our partnering transaction using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units and forward purchase units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.
The issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination, including pursuant to the forward purchase agreement:
    •  
may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering;
    •  
may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock;
    •  
could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;
    •  
may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;
    •  
may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Series A common stock and/or warrants; and
    •  
may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.
Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant indebtedness, it could result in:
    •  
default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a partnering transaction are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;
    •  
acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;
    •  
our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;
    •  
our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;
    •  
our inability to pay dividends on our common stock;
    •  
using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
    •  
limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;
    •  
increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and
    •  
limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.

As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of January 27, 2021, we had no cash, a working capital deficit of $20,000 and deferred offering costs of $40,000. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our partnering transaction will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events
We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our partnering transaction. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After this offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of this offering through receipt of $25,000 from the sale of the founder shares to our sponsor and up to $300,000 in loans from our sponsor under an unsecured promissory note. As of January 27, 2021, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor. Subsequent to January 27, 2021, we borrowed approximately $120,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. We estimate that the net proceeds from (1) the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of approximately $1,500,000 and underwriting commissions of $8,000,000 ($9,200,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $14,000,000 (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)), and (2) the sale of the private placement units for a purchase price of $12,000,000 (or $13,200,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be $402,500,000 (or $462,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, $400,000,000 or $460,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, including $14,000,000 (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions will be deposited into the trust account. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries. The remaining $2,500,000 will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $2,500,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,500,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.
We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) and the proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase units to complete our partnering transaction. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations, based on the number of shares of our common stock authorized and outstanding after the completion of this offering, to be $200,000 per year, which is currently the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. We expect the only taxes payable by us out of the funds in the trust account will be income and franchise taxes. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our taxes. To the extent that our
  93
Table of Contents
capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our partnering transaction, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.
Prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, we will have available to us $2,500,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account. We will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our partnering transaction, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our partnering transaction does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $550,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses in connection with any business combinations; $150,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $600,000 for fees paid to the non-employee directors on our board for their service on the board; $75,000 for NYSE continued listing fees; $960,000 for office space, administrative and support services; and approximately $265,000 for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses.
We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a partnering transaction are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our partnering transaction. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our partnering transaction or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our partnering transaction, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination.
Controls and Procedures
We are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will be required to comply with the internal control reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.
  94
Table of Contents
Prior to the closing of this offering, we have not completed an assessment, nor have our independent registered accounting firm tested our systems, of internal controls. We expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our partnering transaction and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. Many small and mid-sized target businesses we may consider for our partnering transaction may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as:
    •  
staffing for financial, accounting and external reporting areas, including segregation of duties;
    •  
reconciliation of accounts;
    •  
proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate;
    •  
evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions;
    •  
documentation of processes, assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates; and
    •  
documentation of accounting policies and procedures.
Because it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business, we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting.
Once our management’s report on internal controls is complete, we will retain an independent auditor to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The registered public accounting firm may identify additional issues concerning a target business’s internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account will be invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results
As of January 27, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this prospectus as we have conducted no operations to date.
Related Party Transactions
In January 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, with a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the completion of this offering. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect
  95
Table of Contents
to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering. As such, our sponsor will collectively beneficially own 20% of our issued and outstanding capital stock immediately after this offering (assuming our sponsor does not purchase units in this offering). Our sponsor does not intend to purchase any units in this offering. Up to 1,500,000 founder shares are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.
We will enter into a services agreement and facilities sharing agreement pursuant to which we will pay Post and certain of its subsidiaries a total of $40,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our partnering transaction or any liquidation, we may cease paying some or all of these monthly fees.
Our sponsor, officers and directors or Post or its other subsidiaries will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or Post or its other subsidiaries and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.
Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of January 27, 2021, we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor. Subsequent to January 27, 2021, we borrowed approximately $120,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2021 and the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.
In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our partnering transaction, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our partnering transaction does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
Our sponsor will commit, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 1,200,000 private placement units (or 1,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per unit ($12,000,000 in the aggregate or $13,200,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. The private placement units are identical to the units sold in this offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in this prospectus.
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward
  96
Table of Contents
purchase units, consisting of one share of Series B common stock, or a “forward purchase share,” and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, or a “forward purchase warrant,” for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units. Pursuant to an investor rights agreement that we will enter into with our sponsor and Post and a forward purchase agreement that we will enter into with our sponsor on or prior to the closing of this offering, we may be required to register certain securities for sale under the Securities Act. These holders, and holders of warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans, if any, will be entitled under each of the investor rights agreement and the forward purchase agreement to make up to three demands in any 12-month period that we register certain of our securities held by them for sale under the Securities Act and to have the securities covered thereby registered for resale pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. In addition, our sponsor will have the right to include certain of its securities in other registration statements filed by us. However, the investor rights agreement and the forward purchase agreement will provide that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions, as described herein. We will bear the costs and expenses of filing any such registration statements.
JOBS Act
On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things: (1) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (3) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (4) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of this offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.

PROPOSED BUSINESS
Company
Post is a consumer packaged goods holding company with a long history of value creation via strategic corporate actions and efficient capital allocation. Post is forming our company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our “partnering transaction.” An affiliate of Post will act as our sponsor. We have not selected any business with which to partner and have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any candidate with respect to a partnering transaction with us. Although we may pursue a partnering transaction in any industry, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team and our sponsor to partner with a business that has the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns in the consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) industry.
Post generated 279% in total shareholder return since its spin-off from Ralcorp Holdings in 2012 until the COVID-19 pandemic in February 2020 – the highest among Post’s packaged food industry peers. From Post’s spin-off through December 31, 2020, Post generated 278% in total shareholder return, still among the highest of its peers, despite being impacted by the pandemic’s effect on its foodservice business. To achieve these results, Post has transformed from a single-product participant in a secularly declining category into a growing, diversified enterprise across multiple categories.

This transformation was accomplished by utilizing the following strategic guiding principles:
    •  
Long-tenured management team. We believe Post has the longest-tenured management team among its publicly-traded packaged food industry peers, with its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel having joined Post in various capacities in 2011. This continuity and cohesive team structure has created a strong, collaborative culture with significant accumulated institutional knowledge and transaction expertise.
    •  
De-centralized operating structure. Post’s corporate management recognizes that the “operator” skill set is often different than the “capital allocation” or “M&A” skill set. As such, Post retains an operationally-focused management team to run each of its business units and centralizes the capital allocation function. This structure allows each of Post’s business units to achieve operational excellence and be agile and nimble, while remaining autonomous from, but accountable to, the corporate management team at Post. This also enables corporate management to focus on efficient capital allocation and accretive M&A and structured transactions on a holistic basis across the portfolio.
    •  
Creative and pragmatic approach to M&A. Post’s corporate management possesses a deep M&A proficiency, employing leverage and transaction structure to enhance returns. Unlike some corporations with M&A in their DNA, Post is not solely an asset accumulator, but rather seeks to monetize assets opportunistically to unlock shareholder value.
    •  
Broad access to deal flow. Given Post’s extensive M&A track-record and heavy use of the capital markets, corporate management has regular direct contact with various management teams, Board members, and sell-side bankers. The Post team is well suited to transact in situations that require creativity, complexity, or structuring expertise.
    •  
Appropriate use of leverage to enhance equity returns. Post’s corporate management actively manages its balance sheet and has a sophisticated understanding of the capital markets. Since its spin-off, Post has undertaken over 30 capital markets transactions and maintained leverage in a range of 4.0x to 6.0x for most of that time.
Post intends to apply these primary strategic principles to capitalize on the substantial deal flow and opportunity that management sees across the consumer sector. As such, we are seeking to partner with a business in an attractive category, with growth potential organically or through consolidation opportunities, margin upside potential, portfolio optionality, and an experienced management team. Post Management believes that PHPC’s formation, and its position outside of the immediate Post corporate structure, greatly expands the potential universe of targets and target financial profiles that could potentially generate attractive returns for shareholders. We are open to assessing high-growth partners, yet prioritize other criteria, as outlined in Our Investment Criteria. The partnering transaction would provide the candidate business an efficient path to become public, backed by Post’s experience managing consumer products businesses, allocating capital, and building a foundation for future acquisitions and value creation. As a long-term partner, Post will enhance the potential candidate’s ability to generate risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.
Capitalizing on Post’s History
Post’s history is rooted in M&A as a lever for value-creation against an ever-evolving CPG category backdrop.
Post’s legacy dates back to 1895, when C. W. Post incorporated Postum Cereals Company and developed one of the first ready-to-eat (“RTE”) cereal, Grape-Nuts, in 1897. The company became the first packaged food consolidator, as Postum Cereals Company acquired over a dozen companies between 1925 and 1929, expanding its product line to more than 60 products and eventually changing its name to General Foods Corporation.

Philip Morris Companies (“Philip Morris”) acquired the business in 1985 and subsequently merged the business with Kraft Foods Inc. (“Kraft”) in 1989. In 2007, Kraft was separated from Philip Morris, and in 2008, the Post cereals business was split-off from Kraft and combined with Ralcorp Holdings (“Ralcorp”), a manufacturer of private label packaged food. Ultimately, Post was spun-off from Ralcorp and became a separate, standalone company, effective February 3, 2012.
Post’s character as an early food industry consolidator re-emerged when it once again became a standalone public company. A component of management’s initial mandate was to consolidate the RTE cereal category. At the same time, the category began to experience a more pronounced shift in consumption, after decades of low-to-mid single digit growth. Consumers began to exhibit a preference for low-carbohydrate diets, natural ingredients, or non-processed foods, and were substituting protein-based options for cereals. In the face of enhanced competition in a growth-constrained environment, Post developed a diversification strategy that prioritized performance stability and free cash flow generation. Management recognized early and positioned its portfolio accordingly around long-term consumer trends. To diversify its cereal offerings, some of management’s first acquisitions were focused on building a foothold in protein products relevant to the breakfast daypart, both for at-home and on-the-go eating occasions. The acquisitions of Michael Foods and Premier Protein allowed Post to unlock desired strategic diversity. Post later was able to translate those early actions into future value creation when it carved out BellRing, which held Post’s active nutrition businesses including Premier Protein, highlighting that Post is not an asset accumulator, and instead seeks to crystallize value when possible to maximize long-term returns for shareholders. In total, Post has acquired 16 businesses since 2012, growing net sales nearly six times and Adjusted EBITDA over five times.
      1.
Post’s fiscal year end is September 30
Central to Post’s value creation strategy is the simple notion of accessing capital at a reasonable cost and investing the capital in consumer assets with appropriate risk-adjusted return potential. Over its history, Post has been an active issuer in different capital markets including high-yield debt (both term loans and bonds), convertible preferred equity, mandatory convertible equity, and common equity. In addition, Post has also partnered with private equity capital providers (via its formation of 8th Avenue), as well as the public equity markets (via its BellRing carve-out initial public offering, “IPO”). Post management views the market for blank check companies as a natural extension of this strategy of leveraging its capital base through creative financial structures.
Post management believes that the current combination of macro, market, and contextual opportunity have combined to make the present moment the right time to explore value-accretive transactions where Post can apply its core M&A skill set outside of the immediate Post corporate structure. Both Post shareholders and PHPC shareholders have the opportunity to benefit from the formation of PHPC and the complementary, aligned objectives that will guide its pursuit of value creation.

Differentiated Sponsor
Our sponsor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post. Post operates as a holding company for six distinct businesses today. Four of the businesses are wholly-owned, including Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix, Foodservice, and Refrigerated Retail. Two of the businesses are held as investments in non-wholly owned subsidiaries. BellRing is Post’s historical active nutrition business. Post completed an IPO of a minority interest in BellRing in October 2019, monetizing a 28.8% stake in the business while retaining 71.2% for upside in the public markets. 8th Avenue is Post’s historical private brand business, which Post capitalized separately with investments from third parties in October 2018, retaining a 60.5% stake for future upside potential and optionality. Post is familiar with operating as a public company with a complex organizational structure, making it an ideal partner to PHPC.
Post’s operating model with its existing subsidiaries is similar to the expected relationship with our ultimate partner, making Post uniquely qualified to sponsor our business. Each of Post’s six businesses has its own management and operating structure, while capital allocation and M&A are centrally-managed by Post. The subsidiary businesses are unified, but not operationally integrated, by select shared services across the portfolio related to food safety, regulatory and compliance oversight; treasury; finance; investor relations; tax; select information technology; human resources; and corporate legal. De-centralization allows each business to flexibly and quickly respond to market movements, and enables them to be separated in the future without significant disintegration effects or stranded costs.
Stemming from its own strategic principles, Post intends to provide the following support to the ultimate partner as sponsor:
    •  
Consumer products industry expertise and relationships. Post’s management team has a collective 100+ years of industry experience in consumer products. Rob Vitale additionally serves on the board of directors of Energizer Holdings, Inc., a publicly-traded company operating in the household products category. The management team’s relationships with business managers and operators across all corporate functions, as well as among the financial communities that invest in CPG businesses, provides the partnering candidate access to best-in-class leadership and strategic acumen.
    •  
M&A experience and capabilities, including access to deal flow. Post has completed 16 acquisitions since 2012, building the relationships that place it at the nexus of deal flow between strategic and sponsor transactions, while developing the resources and experience to move quickly and decisively. Since future M&A opportunity is a major consideration in our selection of an ultimate partner, Post would be a valuable resource.
      1.
Transformative acquisitions are defined as transactions with a purchase price >$1,000 million
    •  
Tax and structuring expertise and resources. Post’s own corporate organization and transaction experience provide administrative resources and third party relationships that will help optimize corporate and deal structure.
  101
Table of Contents
  •  
Capitalization formation and ongoing balance sheet management. Post already provides treasury services to its business units as well as to its affiliate investments under master services agreements, so an extension of its guidance to our business would be a natural step to leverage its expertise. Post takes a thoughtful, appropriately aggressive, and proactive approach to balance sheet management, having flexed up and down leverage for acquisitions since its spin-off.
    •  
Experienced manager of a public company. Post management has deep expertise in leading a public company. Post intends to leverage its experience to support the partnering candidate as it enters the public markets for the first time.
    •  
Potential shared services. While we will not be integrated into Post as a wholly-owned subsidiary, we expect to have a similar relationship to the sponsor as Post’s current subsidiaries. Post and management will take into account potential revenue and cost synergies that might be available based on common capabilities, customers, operations, or distribution channels in evaluating potential partnering opportunities; Post may be able to offer certain administrative services to leverage costs across a larger portfolio.
Post aims to help build a foundation for our long-term success, and will lend its expertise, resources, and guidance, backed by its initial financial commitment, to start our journey as a public company.
Post’s Investment Track Record Is Highly Relevant Across the Consumer Landscape
When Post became a standalone public company in 2012, it was a single-category business operating in the highly-competitive RTE cereal category with concentrated distribution channels in food, drug, mass, and club, offering only center-of-store products. Since then, Post has transformed into a dynamic, multi-category food company with diversified income streams and portfolio optionality. Post’s experience is relevant across the CPG industry as many categories face similar dynamics.
A core element of Post’s strategy relates to empowering management teams to operate toward a model that prioritizes top-line stability, margin enhancement, free cash flow generation, and agile responses to consumer preferences. The de-centralized model is intentionally designed to increase individual unit’s flexibility, accountability, and entrepreneurship. Post’s performance demonstrates management’s ability to effectively incentivize and guide capital allocation decisions without crafting or developing each unit’s specific operating or go-to-market strategy.
Layered on top of organic growth is a discerning approach to inorganic expansion. Management has acquired 16 companies ranging from sub-$100 million to ~$2.45 billion in size since 2012. Despite the broad diversity in size, category, geography, and other business characteristics, Post’s strategy has been consistent. That is, to build leadership positions in categories with attractive dynamics, diversify the total portfolio by expanding into new categories and channels, while addressing secular themes in food to insulate the portfolio from potential dietary, lifestyle or economic shifts. Post utilizes tax benefits (as appropriate and available) and aims to extract synergies where possible, using integration expertise to buy down the effective purchase multiple and enhance value creation. However, given Post’s de-centralized operating structure and diversified portfolio approach, synergies are not a pre-requisite for pursuing an acquisition that makes strategic sense or unlocks long-term strategic value.
Adherence to its upfront acquisition criteria, combined with effective integration that does not prioritize extreme cost-focused synergy extraction, has enhanced the return of Post’s portfolio and resulted in a strong track record of nearly all M&A targets performing ahead of the acquisition case under Post’s stewardship.

Post’s results with its own business are a clear indicator of its track record. Post has driven attractive total returns for its shareholders and has delivered returns in excess of its peers since its formation.
    Post has also monetized assets opportunistically, using structured M&A to generate return while simultaneously retaining potential future upside. On October 1, 2018, Post completed an independent capitalization of 8th Avenue, providing gross proceeds to Post of $875 million while allowing Post to retain 60.5% in common equity post-closing. 8th Avenue is now a deconsolidated equity investment that is owned jointly with third party investors. On October 21, 2019, BellRing completed an initial public offering, providing net proceeds to Post of $524 million while allowing Post to retain a 71.2% ownership stake. BellRing remains fully-consolidated in Post’s financial results. Based on its current valuation in the public equity markets as of December 31, 2020, BellRing has achieved a more than six times increase in the entity’s enterprise value since the businesses were acquired and combined by Post in 2014. Post is therefore positioned to continue to realize value from growth in these investments, while still having recovered nearly all of its initial cash investment in both assets, providing ongoing strategic and portfolio optionality.

As a sponsor, Post will be providing us with differentiated expertise as a result of its track record of identifying high potential businesses as well as its differentiated access to a deep network of investors worldwide. Additionally, Post’s franchise strength brings capital, credibility, and institutional know-how to execute the partnering transaction quickly.
Our Business Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, partner with and, after our partnering transaction, fundamentally enhance a company in the public markets. We intend to partner with a company in the consumer products industry that complements the experience and expertise of our management team and is a business to which we believe we can add value.
Our management team is deeply familiar with the trends of our target industries and brings an investing approach that offers multiple competitive advantages in sourcing, evaluating and executing on opportunities, including:
    •  
Long-term investment horizon. We take a long-term, strategic view when evaluating our various operating businesses and are less concerned with seeking profits based on near-term volatility or temporary market disruptions.
    •  
Attractive risk-adjusted returns. We believe we can create significant value through efficient capital allocation, appropriately aggressive balance sheet management and a business model that focuses on outsized growth prospects and free cash flow generation.
    •  
Sophisticated transaction structuring to enhance value. We will be creative in our deal structures in order to maximize value creation for our prospective investors and shareholders.
    •  
Differentiated partner sourcing across consumer sectors. Post management is at the nexus of deal flow for both strategics and sponsors. We believe that the capabilities and connections of our management team, in combination with those of Post, will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of partnering opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the M&A markets to replicate.
    •  
Speed and agility to consummate a partnering transaction. Our team has proven managerial expertise in deal execution having previously acquired and divested a number of businesses. We believe that we will be able to conduct candidate sourcing, screening, diligence and execution thoughtfully and efficiently as opportunities arise.
Our Investment Criteria
We have identified general criteria and guidelines for selecting an appropriate target, which we believe are important in evaluating prospective partnering businesses:
    •  
Fundamental business value. We look for businesses with consumer utility, strong brand awareness, and unique value propositions anchored by effective distribution and solid household penetration. We are also looking for businesses that are future-forward and disruptive in the way that they operate and/or the value proposition that they offer to consumers.
    •  
Attractive categories within the consumer products industry broadly. Categories where competitive dynamics remain supportive of growth opportunities, there are pockets of growth or pent-up demand, adjacency opportunities, multiple routes to market, or consolidation potential.
    •  
Well-established strategic moat. Entrenched, defensible leadership positions in core growth categories.
  104
Table of Contents
  •  
Strong margin potential. Attractive Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Margin performance with identifiable opportunities for organic growth and operating leverage through increased scale.
    •  
Strong free cash flow capability. Limited capital expenditure needs and modest working capital requirements to drive strong cash generation.
    •  
Portfolio optionality. Our goal is to build multiple paths to value creation, either with in-bound or out-bound M&A. We favor businesses with platform opportunities, where the structure of a candidate enables building or disaggregating consumer products businesses over time.
    •  
Experienced management team. We will seek to partner with deep, experienced and talented management teams to lead the business and have responsibility for driving operating results.
    •  
Desire to become a standalone public company. We will seek to partner with a business that has a desire to become a standalone public company and retain its economic autonomy.
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Further, we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our partnering transaction with a candidate that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular partnering transaction may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines, as well as other considerations, factors and criteria deemed relevant by our management in effecting our partnering transaction consistent with our business objectives. In the event that we decide to enter into our partnering transaction with a candidate that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the candidate does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our partnering transaction, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
Our Competitive Strengths
The sourcing, valuation, diligence, and execution capabilities of our management team and Post will provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise. Our competitive strengths include the following core principles by which we govern ourselves:
    •  
Long-term orientation. Closing our partnering transaction is important but we are intensely focused on long-term share price performance and the interests of common shareholders post-closing.
    •  
Partnership model. We are not reliant on finding a company which needs operational improvement, cost cutting or replacing senior management. We are not activist investors. We are not buyout specialists. We are not short-term promoters. We have a long-term partnership mentality and collaborative investment model which is grounded and driven by our belief in fairness and alignment of interests.
    •  
Committed co-investment capital. Post intends to utilize its balance sheet to co-invest alongside public market investors. We believe that our initial committed capital in conjunction with our aligned economic interests will allow us to partner with a high quality company.
    •  
Continued ownership. We are focused on partnering with management teams who are focused on long- term compounded growth and existing owners who may want to continue ownership in a high quality asset but need to provide liquidity to existing shareholders and/or limited partners. PHPC provides an ability to transition ownership to the public market, which is deeper and more liquid than the private market, in a disciplined fashion and for existing owners to share in the future upside potential over the long term.

  •  
Deep experience of our sponsor and our management team. We believe that our ability to leverage the operational experience of Post, which has completed over 16 acquisitions since 2012 across a wide spectrum of size, subsector, and ownership structure will provide us with a distinct advantage in being able to source, diligence, and add value post-closing of the partnering transaction.
    •  
Differentiated sourcing channels with leading industry, private equity, and venture capital relationships. Our management team and sponsor believe the capabilities and connections associated with our management team will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of partnering opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We expect these sourcing capabilities will be further bolstered by our management team’s reputation and deep industry, private equity, and venture capital relationships.
    •  
Investing experience. Our management team and sponsor believe that our management’s track record of identifying and sourcing transactions in the consumer sector positions us well to appropriately evaluate potential partnering candidates and select one that will be well received by the public markets and our shareholders.
    •  
Post-closing value-add capabilities and requirement. Our management team and sponsor believe that our combined expertise and reputation will allow us to drive meaningful value post-closing with the partner company. If our value-add is not readily identifiable, then we will choose not to execute that partnering transaction.
We believe our ability to complete a partnering transaction will be enhanced by our having entered into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, each consisting of one forward purchase share and one-fifth of one forward purchase warrant, for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units. The terms of the forward purchase warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in this offering.
Our Process
In evaluating a prospective partnering candidate, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, inspection of physical assets, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us. We will employ third party diligence to support our internal efforts where appropriate. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a partnering transaction without the prior consent of our sponsor.
We are not prohibited from pursuing a partnering transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our partnering transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view.

Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities following this offering, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular candidate is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our partnering transaction. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular partnering transaction if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a candidate business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our partnering transaction.
As described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities, including, in certain cases to Post, pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of our sponsor or any of our directors and officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their business combinations. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our partnering transaction. We believe that potential conflicts with Post are naturally mitigated by the differing nature of the investments Post would typically consider most synergistic to the existing Post businesses and the types of transactions we expect to find most attractive based, in part, on transaction size and ability to operate as a standalone public company.
You should not rely on the historical record or performance of Post or our management team as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward. See “Risk Factors — Past performance by Post and members of our management team may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.”

Partnering Transaction
NYSE listing rules require that our partnering transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our partnering transaction. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our partnering transaction, although there is no assurance that will be the case.
  108
Table of Contents
We anticipate structuring our partnering transaction so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our partnering transaction such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target, our stockholders prior to our partnering transaction may collectively own a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-business combination company, depending on, among other things, valuations ascribed to the target and us in our partnering transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target, issue a substantial number of new shares to third-parties in connection with financing our partnering transaction or our sponsor could convert some or all of its Series B common stock into Series A common stock. In such cases, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock or other changes to our capital structure, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction (including our sponsor) could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction and therefore a minority interest (economic and/or voting) in the post-transaction company. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our partnering transaction involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net assets test.
Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our partnering transaction.
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
We believe our management team’s significant transaction experience and industry relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
We believe this network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
We are not prohibited from pursuing a partnering transaction with a business that is owned by our sponsor or any of the related companies, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared
  109
Table of Contents
ownership with any of them. In the event we seek to complete our partnering transaction with a target that is owned by the related companies, our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, expect to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another accounting, valuation or appraisal that firm such partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. However, we are not required to obtain such an opinion in any context.
See “Management —  Conflicts of Interest” for information regarding limitations on our access to investment opportunities sourced by members of our management team, Post and other entities in which members of our management team are involved, including a list of our executive officers and directors and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers and our company.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we will offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Financial Position
With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $488,500,000 (which includes $100,000,000 that may be received pursuant to the forward purchase agreement) assuming no redemptions and after payment of $14,000,000 of deferred underwriting fees (or $546,400,000 (which includes the $100,000,000 that may be received pursuant to the forward purchase agreement) assuming no redemptions and after payment of up to $16,100,000 of deferred underwriting fees if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), after estimated offering expenses of $1,500,000 (and prior to any estimated post-IPO working capital expenses of $2,500,000), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our partnering transaction using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility
  110
Table of Contents
to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting our Partnering Transaction
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following this offering. We intend to effectuate our partnering transaction using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units and forward purchase units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our partnering transaction. We may seek to complete our partnering transaction with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our partnering transaction is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our partnering transaction or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our partnering transaction, to fund the purchase of other businesses or for working capital.
We have not selected any specific partnering candidate and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions directly or indirectly, with any partnering candidate with respect to a partnering transaction with us. The members of our management team and Post and other entities in which members of our management team are involved are from time to time made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not selected any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to a partnering transaction with us. See “— Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets,” “— Conflicts of Interest” and “Management — Conflicts of Interest” for additional information regarding limitations on our access to investment opportunities sourced by members of our management team, Post and other entities in which members of our management team are involved.
In addition to the forward purchase agreement, we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction, and we may effectuate our partnering transaction using the proceeds of such offerings or loans rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
In the case of a partnering transaction funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or we decide to do so for business or other reasons, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our partnering transaction. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Partnering Transaction
NYSE listing rules require that our partnering transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our partnering transaction. The fair market value of the
  111
Table of Contents
target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our partnering transaction, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our partnering transaction solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete a partnering transaction if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our partnering transaction.
To the extent we effect our partnering transaction with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information that will be made available to us.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our partnering transaction, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our partnering transaction is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our partnering transaction, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business.
By completing our partnering transaction with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:
    •  
solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or
    •  
dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
  112
Table of Contents
This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our partnering transaction.
Potential Management Concerns Post-Partnering Transaction
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our partnering transaction with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our partnering transaction, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place and it is highly unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our partnering transaction. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the post-business combination company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our partnering transaction.
Following our partnering transaction, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management team.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Partnering Transaction
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of partnering transactions we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
  Type of Transaction   
Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
Purchase of assets    No
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company    No
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company    No
Merger of the company with a target    Yes
Under NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our partnering transaction if, for example:
    •  
we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) shares of common stock that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock (other than in a public offering) then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
    •  
any of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of shares of common stock could result in an increase in issued and
  113
Table of Contents
  outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 1% or more (or 5% or more if the related party involved is classified as such solely because such person is a substantial security holder); or
    •  
the issuance or potential issuance will result in our undergoing a change of control.
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and other reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
    •  
the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
    •  
the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
    •  
the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
    •  
other time and budget constraints of the company; and
    •  
additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
Permitted purchases and other transactions with respect to our securities
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies and their directors, officers or advisors may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our partnering transaction. There is no limit on the number of securities such persons may purchase. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our partnering transaction, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies and their directors, officers or advisors may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our partnering transaction or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such purchases or other transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such purchases or other transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies and their directors, officers or advisors purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our partnering transaction, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our partnering transaction. We do not currently anticipate
  114
Table of Contents
that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such transaction could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the partnering transaction and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the partnering transaction, (2) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our partnering transaction or (3) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the consummation of our partnering transaction, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions may result in the completion of our partnering transaction that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Series A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our sponsor, officers, directors, and advisors anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors, or advisors or any of the related companies or their officers, directors or advisors may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the case of public shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our partnering transaction. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, or advisors or any of the related companies or their officers, directors or advisors enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our partnering transaction. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our partnering transaction. Our sponsor, officers, directors, or advisors or any of the related companies or their officers, directors or advisors will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by any person who is an affiliated purchaser under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be restricted unless such purchases are made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, and directors and any of the related companies and their officers and directors will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Partnering Transaction
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our partnering transaction at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per
  115
Table of Contents
public share. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our partnering transaction with respect to our warrants. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Series A common stock upon the completion of our partnering transaction either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. Except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
    •  
conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
    •  
file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our partnering transaction which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the partnering transaction and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
Upon the public announcement of our partnering transaction, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Series A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our partnering transaction until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our partnering transaction. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such partnering transaction, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).
  116
Table of Contents
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
    •  
conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
    •  
file proxy materials with the SEC.
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon the consummation of the partnering transaction.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, we will complete our partnering transaction only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination, subject to any other vote required by applicable law. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will count towards this quorum and will agree to vote any shares held by them in favor of our partnering transaction. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to our partnering transaction, our sponsor and its permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) entitled to vote thereon. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements may make it more likely that we will consummate our partnering transaction. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting and, if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our partnering transaction. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Series A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Series A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination (including, potentially, with the same target).

Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Partnering Transaction if we Seek Stockholder Approval
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our sponsor to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our partnering transaction, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our partnering transaction.
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the partnering transaction at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by some blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, some blank check companies would
  118
Table of Contents
distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on a partnering transaction, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or two business days prior to the scheduled date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable (unless we elect to allow additional withdrawal rights). Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our partnering transaction.
If our partnering transaction is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination until 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Partnering Transaction
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) to complete our partnering transaction. If we have not completed our partnering transaction within such period or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the 24-month (or 27-month, as applicable) time period.
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period (although our sponsor,
  119
Table of Contents
officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame).
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Series A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the estimated $2,500,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. See “Risk Factors — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management team will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.
Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to
  120
Table of Contents
be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor will agree that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; and (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor, which is a newly formed entity, has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our partnering transaction and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our partnering transaction, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; and (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per public share. See “Risk Factors — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to an estimated $1,500,000 from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with any liquidation,
  121
Table of Contents
currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,500,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,500,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction within the required time period may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our partnering transaction within the required time period is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of our acquisition period and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
  122
Table of Contents
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below the lesser of: (1) $10.00 per public share; and (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. See “Risk Factors — If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.”
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction and then, only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our partnering transaction, a stockholder’s voting in connection with our partnering transaction alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. Holders of warrants will not have any rights to proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants.
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our partnering transaction. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100%
  123
Table of Contents
of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree to waive any redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that:
    •  
prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, we shall either: (1) seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction at a meeting called for such purpose, in connection with which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable); or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
    •  
we will consummate our partnering transaction only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination at a duly held stockholders meeting, subject to any other vote required by applicable law;
    •  
if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) from the closing of this offering, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; and
    •  
prior to our partnering transaction, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation on any partnering transaction.
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock.
Additionally, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to vote on the election of directors and that holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock may remove members of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock.

Calculation of redemption price or other permitted purchases
  Redemptions at the time of our partnering transaction may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a stockholder vote. In either case, our public stockholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the partnering transaction (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share), including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitation that no redemptions will take place if all of the redemptions would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions, and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) agreed to in connection with the negotiation of terms of a proposed business combination.   If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction, our sponsor, directors, officers, or advisors or any of the related companies or their directors, officers or advisors may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our partnering transaction. Such purchases will be restricted except to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions.   If we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share), including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.

Impact to remaining stockholders
  The redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction will reduce the book value per share for our remaining stockholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and interest withdrawn in order to pay taxes (to the extent not paid from amounts accrued as interest on the funds held in the trust account).   If the permitted purchases described above are made, there will be no impact to our remaining stockholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us.   The redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our partnering transaction will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our sponsor, who will be our only remaining stockholder after such redemptions.
Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419
The following table compares the terms of this offering to the terms of an offering by a blank check company subject to the provisions of Rule 419. This comparison assumes that the gross proceeds, underwriting commissions and underwriting expenses of our offering would be identical to those of an offering undertaken by a company subject to Rule 419, and that the underwriters will not exercise their over-allotment option. None of the provisions of Rule 419 apply to our offering.
       Terms of Our Offering
   Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering
Escrow of offering proceeds
   NYSE listing rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement units be deposited in a trust account. $400,000,000 of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units will be deposited into a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.    Approximately $340,200,000 of the offering proceeds, representing the gross proceeds of this offering less allowable underwriting commissions, expenses and company deductions under Rule 419, would be required to be deposited into either an escrow account with an insured depositary institution or in a separate bank account established by a broker-dealer in which the broker-dealer acts as trustee for persons having the beneficial interests in the account.
Investment of net proceeds
   $400,000,000 of the net offering proceeds and the sale of the private placement units held in trust will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.    Proceeds could be invested only in specified securities such as a money market fund meeting conditions of the Investment Company Act or in securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States.

     Terms of Our Offering
   Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering
Receipt of interest on escrowed funds
   Interest on proceeds from the trust account to be paid to stockholders is reduced by: (1) any taxes paid or payable; and (2) in the event of any liquidation for failure to complete our partnering transaction within the allotted time, up to $100,000 of net interest that may be released to us should we have no or insufficient working capital to fund the costs and expenses of our dissolution and liquidation.    Interest on funds in escrow account would be held for the sole benefit of investors, unless and only after the funds held in escrow were released to us in connection with our completion of a business combination.
Limitation on fair value or net assets of target business
   NYSE listing rules require that our partnering transaction must be with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our partnering transaction.    The fair value or net assets of a target business must represent at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds.
Trading of securities issued
   The units will begin trading on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Series A common stock and warrants constituting the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such date is not a business day, the following business day), unless Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or    No trading of the units or the underlying common stock and warrants would be permitted until the completion of a business combination. During this period, the securities would be held in the escrow or trust account.

   amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.   
Exercise of the warrants
   The warrants cannot be exercised until the later of 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction and 12 months from the closing of this offering.    The warrants could be exercised prior to the completion of a business combination, but securities received and cash paid in connection with the exercise would be deposited in the escrow or trust account.
Election to remain an investor
   We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, including interest, which interest shall be net of taxes payable, upon the completion of our partnering transaction, subject to the limitations described herein. We may not be required by applicable law or stock exchange rule to hold a stockholder vote. If we are not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule and do not otherwise decide to hold a stockholder vote, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the partnering transaction and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If, however, we hold a stockholder vote, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy    A prospectus containing information pertaining to the business combination required by the SEC would be sent to each investor. Each investor would be given the opportunity to notify the company in writing, within a period of no less than 20 business days and no more than 45 business days from the effective date of a post-effective amendment to the company’s registration statement, to decide if he, she or it elects to remain a stockholder of the company or require the return of his, her or its investment. If the company has not received the notification by the end of the 45th business day, funds and interest or dividends, if any, held in the trust or escrow account are automatically returned to the stockholder. Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all funds on deposit in the escrow account must be returned to all of the investors and none of the securities are issued.

   solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our partnering transaction only if the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination, subject to any other vote required by applicable law. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting.
  Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting and, if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction.
   Business combination deadline
   If we have not completed a partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10    If an acquisition has not been completed within 18 months after the effective date of the company’s registration statement, funds held in the trust or escrow account are returned to investors.

Release of funds
   Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our partnering transaction; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event)    The proceeds held in the escrow account are not released until the earlier of the completion of a business combination and the failure to effect a business combination within the allotted time.

   or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), subject to applicable law.   
Limitation on redemption rights of stockholders holding more than 15% of the shares sold in this offering if we hold a stockholder vote
   If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares (more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in this offering), without our prior consent. Our public stockholders’ inability to redeem Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our partnering transaction and they could suffer a material loss on their investment in us if they sell Excess Shares in open market transactions.    Most blank check companies provide no restrictions on the ability of stockholders to redeem shares based on the number of shares held by such stockholders in connection with a partnering transaction.
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
   We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders or up to two business days prior to the    In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, holders could vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holders were seeking to exercise their redemption rights.

   scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our partnering transaction will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights.    to arrange for them to deliver their certificate to verify ownership.
Competition
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there will be numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our partnering transaction and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating and completing a business combination.
Facilities
We currently maintain our executive offices at 2503 S. Hanley Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63144. The cost for this space is included in the $40,000 per month fee that we will pay Post and certain of its subsidiaries for office

Table of Contents
space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have 2 officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our partnering transaction. Such officers are all employees of Post and receive their compensation directly from Post. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our partnering transaction. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our partnering transaction and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We will register our units, Series A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our partnering transaction.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Table of Contents
If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Legal Proceedings
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 12 months preceding the date of this prospectus.

Number, Terms of Office and Election of Officers and Directors
Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we expect that our board of directors will consist of five members. Following the consummation of our partnering transaction, our board of directors will be divided into three classes, with only one class of directors being elected in each year, and with each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of      independent director, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of an additional      independent directors, will expire at our second annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of                  and an additional director nominee of our sponsor, will expire at our third annual meeting of stockholders.
Prior to consummation of our partnering transaction, holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to elect all of our directors and remove members of our board of directors for any reason. Holders of our public shares will not have the right to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock. Approval of our partnering transaction will require the affirmative vote of a majority of our board directors, which must include a majority of our independent directors. Subject to any other special rights applicable to the stockholders, prior to our partnering transaction, any vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present and voting at the meeting of our board of directors that includes any directors representing our sponsor then on our board of directors, or by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock.
  136
Table of Contents
Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our amended and restated bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that our officers may consist of a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief Financial Officer, Vice Presidents, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.
Director Independence
NYSE listing rules require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an executive officer or employee of the company or any of its parents or subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We intend to add “independent directors” as defined in NYSE listing rules and applicable SEC rules prior to completion of this offering. Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we expect to have three “independent directors” as defined in the NYSE listing rules and applicable SEC rules prior to completion of this offering. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Executive Officer and Director Compensation
Our executive officers are all employees of Post and receive their compensation directly from Post. Upon completion of this offering, we will execute a services agreement with Post pursuant to which Post will cause our management team and other Post personnel to provide us with the services we need to conduct our business in exchange for a flat monthly fee of $40,000.
We will pay fees in cash to each of our non-employee directors for service on our board of directors in the amounts of $50,000 on each of the closing of this offering, the one-year anniversary of the closing of this offering, and the earlier of (x) the two-year anniversary of the closing of this offering and (y) the closing of our partnering transaction;.
In addition, our sponsor, Post and its subsidiaries, and their officers and directors will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or Post or its other subsidiaries.
After the completion of our partnering transaction, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other compensation from the combined company. All compensation by us to our directors and executive officers will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time such materials are distributed, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers after the completion of our partnering transaction will be determined by a corporate governance and compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors.
We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment, although certain of the related companies are. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business, and we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the completion of our partnering transaction should be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination.

Committees of the Board of Directors
Upon the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our board of directors will have two standing committees: an audit committee and a corporate governance and compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of NYSE and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of NYSE require that the corporate governance and compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Both our audit committee and our corporate governance and compensation committee will be composed solely of independent directors.
Audit Committee
Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors. Three independent directors will serve as members of our audit committee. We expect at least one independent director will meet the independent director standard under NYSE listing rules and under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, and will serve as chairman of the audit committee.
Each member of the audit committee will be financially literate and our board of directors may determine that an independent director qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules.
We will adopt an audit committee charter, which will detail the scope and principal functions of the audit committee, including:
    •  
assisting board oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and registered public accounting firm;
    •  
the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the registered public accounting firm and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;
    •  
pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the registered public accounting firm or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures;
    •  
reviewing and discussing with the registered public accounting firm all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;
    •  
setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the registered public accounting firm;
    •  
setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
    •  
obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the registered public accounting firm describing (1) the registered public accounting firm’s internal quality-control procedures and (2) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;
    •  
meeting to review and discuss our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent auditor, including reviewing our specific disclosures under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”;
  138
Table of Contents
  •  
reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC; and
    •  
reviewing with management, the registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee
Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish a corporate governance and compensation committee of the board of directors, consisting of at least two independent directors as members of our corporate governance and compensation committee. One of our independent directors meeting the independent director standard under NYSE listing rules will serve as chairman of the corporate governance and compensation committee. We will adopt a corporate governance and compensation committee charter, which will detail the purpose, responsibilities, scope and principal functions of the corporate governance and compensation committee, including:
    •  
reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;
    •  
reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;
    •  
reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;
    •  
implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;
    •  
assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;
    •  
approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees;
    •  
producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement;
    •  
reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors;
    •  
identifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors, consistent with criteria approved by the board, and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the board of directors;
    •  
developing and recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines;
    •  
coordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the management in the governance of the company; and
    •  
reviewing our overall corporate governance from time to time and recommending improvements as and when necessary.
The charter will also provide that the corporate governance and compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel
  139

or any other adviser, the corporate governance and compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by NYSE and the SEC. The corporate governance and compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of, and terminate, any search firm to be used to identify director candidates, and will be directly responsible for approving the search firm’s fees and other retention terms.
We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. Prior to our partnering transaction, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board of directors.

None of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, (i) as a member of the compensation committee or board of directors of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on our corporate governance and compensation committee, or (ii) as a member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on our board of directors.
Code of Ethics
Prior to the closing of this offering, we will have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct (our “Code of Ethics”) applicable to our directors, officers and employees. A copy of our Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”
Conflicts of Interest
All of our officers also serve as executive officers of one or more of the related companies, and there are overlapping directors with such entities. Our officers and members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at any of the related companies have fiduciary duties to that company’s stockholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and one or more of related companies to which they owe fiduciary duties.
Each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities (including, without limitation, to one or more of the entities listed in this section) pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a partnering transaction opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Also, none of Post, our sponsor or any of our directors and officers is prohibited from sponsoring, investing or otherwise becoming involved with, any other blank check companies, including in connection with their business combinations. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company, such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity.

Moreover, most of our directors and officers continue to own stock and options to purchase stock in one or more of the related companies. These ownership interests and/or such disparity could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company and the related companies.
Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:
    •  
None of our officers or directors is required to, nor will he or she, commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, each of our officers may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among our operations, including our search for a partnering transaction, and these other businesses.
    •  
In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities of which they are also officers or directors. Our management may be required to present such business opportunities to such entities before presenting such opportunity to us.
    •  
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction. Additionally, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them if we fail to consummate our partnering transaction within 24 months (or 27 months upon an agreement in principle event) after the closing of this offering or during any Extension Period. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors then hold any public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the allotted time frame to complete our partnering transaction. If we do not complete our partnering transaction within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the private placement warrants will expire worthless. With certain exceptions as described under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants,” the founder shares will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our sponsor until the earlier of: (1) one year after the completion of our partnering transaction; and (2) subsequent to our partnering transaction, (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our partnering transaction. With certain exceptions, the private placement warrants and the shares of our common stock underlying such warrants, will not be transferable, assignable or salable by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction. Since our sponsor, officers and directors may directly or indirectly own our common stock and warrants following this offering, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our partnering transaction.
    •  
Our key personnel may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such key personnel was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our partnering transaction.
The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.
In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:
    •  
the corporation is financially able to exploit the opportunity;
  141
Table of Contents
  •  
the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business;
    •  
the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity; and
    •  
by taking the opportunity for his or her own, the corporate fiduciary will thereby be placed in a position inimical to his duties to the corporation.
Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors have similar legal obligations or duties relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Below is a table summarizing the entities to which our officers, directors and director nominees currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may present a conflict of interest:
  Name of Individual   
Entity Name
   Entity’s Business
   Affiliation
                                                                             Accordingly, if any of the above officers or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us.
We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations described above will materially affect our ability to complete our partnering transaction. As noted above, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company; such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue; and such person has no fiduciary or contractual obligation to present the opportunity to any other person or entity.
In the event that we submit our partnering transaction to our public stockholders for a vote, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, and their permitted transferees will agree, to vote our common stock held by them in favor of our partnering transaction.
Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the DGCL.
We will enter into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our amended and restated bylaws also permit us to maintain insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We will obtain a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.
A stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.
  142
Table of Contents
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of the date of this prospectus, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our common stock included in the units offered by this prospectus, and assuming no purchase of units in this offering, by:
    •  
each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;
    •  
each of our executive officers, directors and director nominees; and
    •  
all our executive officers, directors and director nominees as a group.
Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this prospectus.
The after-offering percentages in the following table assumes that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, that our sponsor forfeits an aggregate of 1,500,000 founder shares and that there are 51,200,000 shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering.

Interests shown consist solely of shares of Series F common stock which are referred to herein as founder shares, and excludes the shares of Series A common stock underlying the private placement units. Such founder shares will automatically convert into shares of Series B common stock at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, as described under “Description of Securities.” Prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock. Excludes forward purchase securities that will only be issued, if at all, at the time of our partnering transaction.
(3)
Interests shown include the shares of Series A common stock to be issued as a part of the sale of the private placement units.
(4)
Post is the sole member and manager of our sponsor. Post may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by our sponsor by virtue of its direct ownership over our sponsor.
Upon the completion of this offering, our sponsor will beneficially own 20% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private
  144
Table of Contents
placement units and assuming our sponsor does not purchase any units in this offering). As a result of holding substantially all of the founder shares, our sponsor will have the right, prior to our partnering transaction, to elect all of our directors and remove any director for any reason. Holders of our public shares will not have the right to appoint any directors to our board of directors prior to our partnering transaction. In addition, because of this ownership block, our sponsor may be able to effectively influence the outcome of all other matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering.
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, consisting of one share of Series B common stock, or a “forward purchase share,” and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, or a “forward purchase warrant,” for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units. Our sponsor has agreed (a) to vote any founder shares, private placement shares and public shares held by it in favor of any proposed business combination and (b) not to redeem any founder shares or public shares held by it in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed partnering transaction.
Our sponsor and our officers and directors are deemed to be our “promoters” as such term is defined under the federal securities laws. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” for additional information regarding our relationships with our promoters.
Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units
The founder shares, private placement units, private placement shares, private placement warrants (and any shares of Series A common stock issued upon exercise thereof) are each subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in the letter agreement with us to be entered into by our sponsor, executive officers and directors. Those lock-up provisions will provide that such securities are not transferable, assignable or salable (1) in the case of the founder shares, until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our partnering transaction and (B) subsequent to our partnering transaction, (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after completion of our partnering transaction, and (2) in the case of the private placement units, private placement shares, private placement warrants and the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise thereof, until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction. Notwithstanding the above, during the applicable lock-up period our sponsor will be able to transfer founder shares, private placement units, private placement shares, private placement warrants (and any shares of Series A common stock issued upon exercise thereof) (a) to our officers, Post’s directors or
  145
Table of Contents
officers, their respective family members and entities formed by such persons for investment or estate planning purposes which are controlled by such persons or formed for their benefit or for charitable purposes, (b) to Post or any entity in which Post or the officers and directors of Post hold, in the aggregate, securities representing no less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of such entity (so long as no other holder or group holds a higher percentage of the voting power of such entity), and the subsidiaries of each of the foregoing, (c) to any corporation or other entity which, as a result of any spinoff, splitoff or other distribution transaction, becomes the beneficial owner of the founder shares and private placement warrants (and shares issuable upon the exercise of such warrants), or (d) by private sales or transfers made in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the securities were originally purchased; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (d) such permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions. In addition, our sponsor or its permitted transferees will be permitted to pledge or grant a security interest in such securities to secure bona fide indebtedness or engage in certain hedging transactions; provided, that the holder thereof retains voting control over such securities prior to delivery of shares upon foreclosure or upon satisfaction of the hedge. In the event of any liquidation prior to our completion of our partnering transaction or our completion of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction which results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Series A common stock for cash, securities or other property subsequent to our completion of our partnering transaction, the lockup period will be deemed terminated. In no event will any such transfer restrictions prohibit or otherwise restrict Post’s ability to reattribute its interest in our sponsor or us between or among its tracking stock groups, combine such tracking stock groups or otherwise take actions with respect to its tracking stock groups provided for or permitted by Post’s organizational documents or its policies.
Registration Rights
The holders of the founder shares, forward purchase shares, forward purchase warrants, private placement shares, private placement warrants and shares and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants, forward purchase warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans and upon conversion of the founder shares and the forward purchase shares) will be entitled to registration rights with respect to private placement shares, private placement warrants, forward purchase warrants, shares and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans, warrants purchased by them in the open market and shares of Series A common stock purchased by them in the open market or issuable upon (1) conversion of the founder shares, (2) exercise of the private placement warrants, (3) conversion of the forward purchase shares and shares of Series B common stock purchased in connection with our partnering transaction (if any), (4) exercise of the forward purchase warrants and (5) exercise of warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans (if any), pursuant to an investor rights agreement and forward purchase agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering requiring us to register such securities for resale. The holder of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands in any 12-month period under each agreement, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our partnering transaction and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, both the investor rights agreement and the forward purchase agreement will provide that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions, as described herein. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In January 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, with a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per share. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering. As such, our sponsor will collectively beneficially own 20% of our issued and outstanding capital stock immediately after this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units and assuming our sponsor does not purchase units in this offering). Our sponsor does not intend to purchase any units in this offering. Up to 1,500,000 founder shares are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.
Our sponsor will commit, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 1,200,000 private placement units (or 1,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per unit ($12,000,000 in the aggregate or $13,200,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. The private placement units are identical to the units sold in this offering, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in this prospectus. Each whole private placement warrant underlying the private placement units entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein. The private placement warrants (including the Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction.
In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to which our sponsor will commit to purchase from us up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units, consisting of one share of Series B common stock, or a “forward purchase share,” and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, or a “forward purchase warrant,” for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of our partnering transaction. The proceeds from the sale of these forward purchase units, together with the amounts available to us from the trust account (after giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the partnering transaction, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the partnering transaction, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-partnering transaction company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the trust account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, our sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 forward purchase units. As described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” each of our officers and directors has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more entities pursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities before he or she presents such opportunity to us. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to another entity, he or she may only present such opportunity to us if such other entity rejects the opportunity. For more information, see “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”
We will enter into a services agreement and facilities sharing agreement pursuant to which we will also pay Post and certain of its subsidiaries a total of $40,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our partnering transaction or any liquidation, we may cease paying some or all of these monthly fees. Accordingly, in the event the completion of our partnering transaction takes up to 24 months, subsidiaries of Post will be paid a total of $960,000 ($40,000 per month) for office space, administrative and support services and will be entitled to be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses.
  147
Table of Contents
Our sponsor, officers and directors or Post or its other subsidiaries will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or Post or its other subsidiaries and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such persons in connection with activities on our behalf.
Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of January 27, 2021 we had not borrowed any amount under the promissory note with our sponsor. Subsequent to January, 27, 2021, we borrowed approximately $120,000 under the promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2021 and the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the trust account.
In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our partnering transaction, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In the event that our partnering transaction does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. The units would be identical to the private placement units issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, Post or its subsidiaries, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.
After our partnering transaction, members of our management team who remain with us, if any, may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our partnering transaction, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive officer and director compensation.
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive: (a) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction; (b) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (c) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period (although our sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame). Additionally, if we seek stockholder approval in connection with our partnering transaction, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, pursuant to the terms of the
  148
Table of Contents
letter agreement, and their permitted transferees will agree, to vote any of our common stock held by them in favor of our partnering transaction.
We will enter into an investor rights agreement providing for registration rights with respect to private placement shares, private placement warrants, forward purchase shares and forward purchase warrants, shares and warrants underlying units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and shares of Series A common stock issuable upon (1) conversion of the founder shares, (2) exercise of private placement warrants, (3) conversion of the forward purchase shares, (4) exercise of the forward purchase warrants and (5) exercise of warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans (if any). The investor rights agreement will also provide that our sponsor will be entitled, upon consummation of our partnering transaction, to nominate three individuals for appointment to our board of directors, as long as the sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration rights described in the paragraph above.
Related Party Policy
We have not yet adopted a formal policy for the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions. Accordingly, the transactions discussed above were not reviewed, approved or ratified in accordance with any such policy.
Prior to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt our Code of Ethics requiring us to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved by our board of directors (or the appropriate committee of our board of directors) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our Code of Ethics, conflict of interest situations will include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the company.
In addition, our audit committee, pursuant to a written charter that we will adopt prior to the consummation of this offering, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions to the extent that we enter into such transactions. An affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the audit committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be required in order to approve a related party transaction. A majority of the members of the entire audit committee will constitute a quorum. Without a meeting, the unanimous written consent of all of the members of the audit committee will be required to approve a related party transaction. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors or Post or its other subsidiaries.
These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.
To further minimize conflicts of interest, we expect not to consummate a partnering transaction with a business that is owned by any of the related companies, or our sponsor, or its or their officers or directors unless we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another accounting, valuation or appraisal firm that such partnering transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. There will be no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by us to our sponsor, Post or its other subsidiaries, or their officers or directors, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction, other than, the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units held in the trust account prior to the completion of our partnering transaction:
    •  
repayment of an aggregate of up to $300,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;
    •  
payment to certain subsidiaries of Post of a total of $40,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services;

  •  
payments of fees in cash to each of our non-employee directors for service on our board of directors in the amounts of $50,000 on each of the closing of this offering, the one-year anniversary of the closing of this offering, and the earlier of (x) the two-year anniversary of the closing of this offering and (y) the closing of our partnering transaction;
    •  
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing a partnering transaction; and
    •  
repayment of loans which may be made by our sponsor or Post or its other subsidiaries to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, the terms of which have not been determined nor have any written agreements been executed with respect thereto. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans made to us may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.
These payments may be funded using the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, in each case to the extent not held in the trust account or, upon the consummation of the partnering transaction, from any amounts remaining from the proceeds of the trust account released to us in connection therewith.

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which will be adopted upon the consummation of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of 500,000,000 shares of Series A common stock, $0.0001 par value, 80,000,000 shares of Series B common stock, $0.0001 par value, 40,000,000 shares of Series C common stock, $0.0001 par value, 40,000,000 shares of Series F common stock, $0.0001 par value, and 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, $0.0001 par value. The following description summarizes the material terms of our capital stock. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.
Units
Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one share of Series A common stock and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of the company’s Series A common stock. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at by a warrant holder following the consummation of our partnering transaction as described below.
The common stock and warrants constituting the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such date is not a business day, the following business day), unless Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the shares of Series A common stock and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into shares of Series A common stock and warrants. Additionally, the units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded after completion of our partnering transaction. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you are separating at least four units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant.
In no event will the Series A common stock and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet of our company reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds at the closing of this offering and the sale of the private placement units. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering which will include this audited balance sheet. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.
Additionally, the units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded after completion of our partnering transaction.
In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended partnering transaction, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Up to $2,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into units at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender. Such units would be identical to the private placement units issued to our sponsor.

Common Stock
Upon the closing of this offering, 51,200,000 shares of our common stock will be outstanding (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option and the corresponding forfeiture of an aggregate of 1,500,000 founder shares by our sponsor), including:
    •  
40,000,000 shares of our Series A common stock underlying the units being offered in this offering;
    •  
10,000,000 shares of Series F common stock held by our sponsor; and
    •  
1,200,000 private placement shares held by our sponsor.
If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution back to capital or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering.
Prior to our partnering transaction, holders of the Series A common stock, holders of our Series B common stock, if any, and holders of the Series F common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders, including any vote in connection with our partnering transaction, and vote together as a single class; provided that, prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to elect our directors and remove members of our board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock.
Following our partnering transaction, holders of our Series A common stock and holders of our Series B common stock will generally vote together as a single class on matters presented for a stockholder vote, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of Series A common stock entitling the holder to one vote per share and each share of Series B common stock entitling the holder to ten votes per share.
Holders of the Series C common stock will not be entitled to any voting powers, except as otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rule. When so required, holders of Series C common stock will be entitled to 1/100th of a vote for each share of such stock held.
Prior to our partnering transaction, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock is required to approve the election or removal of directors. Following the consummation of our partnering transaction, our board of directors will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that, prior to our partnering transaction, the holders of more than 50% of the Series F common stock voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor.
Because our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of up to 500,000,000 shares of Series A common stock, if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase the number of shares of common stock which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our stockholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek stockholder approval in connection with our partnering transaction.
In accordance with NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. Under Section 211(b) of
  152
Table of Contents
the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares upon the completion of our partnering transaction at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the completion of our partnering transaction, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial owner must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction or certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Permitted transferees of our sponsor, executive officers and directors will be subject to the same obligations.
Unlike some blank check companies that hold stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their partnering transactions and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such partnering transactions even when a vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, if a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our partnering transaction. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the partnering transaction and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If, however, a stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our partnering transaction only if a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination, subject to any other vote required by applicable law. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of our outstanding capital stock representing a majority of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors or advisors in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result in the approval of our partnering transaction even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock for the purposes of our partnering transaction, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our partnering transaction once a quorum is obtained. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our partnering transaction. These quorum and voting thresholds, and agreements, may make it more likely that we will consummate our partnering transaction.
If we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder
  153
Table of Contents
or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming Excess Shares, without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our partnering transaction. Our stockholders’ inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our partnering transaction, and such stockholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such stockholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete the business combination. And, as a result, such stockholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.
If we seek stockholder approval in connection with our partnering transaction, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, and their permitted transferees will agree, to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and our common stock held by them in favor of our partnering transaction. As a result, in addition to our sponsor’s founder shares and private placement shares, we would need 14,400,001, or 36.0% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), or 1,600,001, or 4.00% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised), of the 40,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a partnering transaction in order to have such partnering transaction approved. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting and, if it does vote, irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction.
Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) (although our sponsor, executive officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame).
In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our stockholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock, if any, having preference over the common stock. Our stockholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock, except that we will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), upon the completion of our partnering transaction, subject to the limitations described herein.
Founder Shares
The founder shares are identical to the shares of Series A common stock included in the units being sold in this offering, except that: (1) prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of the Series F common stock
  154
Table of Contents
have the right to vote on the election of directors and holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock may remove members of our board of directors for any reason; (2) following our partnering transaction, holders of the Series B common stock and holders of the Series A common stock will vote together as a single class, with each share of Series B common stock having ten votes per share and each share of Series A common stock having one vote per share except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule; (3) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail above; (4) our sponsor, executive officers and directors will enter into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they will agree to waive: (a) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with the completion of our partnering transaction; (b) their redemption rights with respect to our common stock held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity; and (c) their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period (although our sponsor, officers and directors will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our partnering transaction within the prescribed time frame); (5) shares of our Series F common stock are automatically convertible into shares of our Series B common stock at the time of our partnering transaction, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, and, prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock; and (6) the holders of founder shares are entitled to registration rights. If we submit our partnering transaction to our public stockholders for a vote, our sponsor, executive officers and directors will agree (and their permitted transferees will agree), pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, to vote all founder shares, private placement shares, and public shares held by them purchased during or after this offering in favor of our partnering transaction.
Prior to and following our partnering transaction, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of our Series A common stock.
With certain exceptions as described under “Principal Stockholders - Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants,” the founder shares are not transferable, assignable or salable until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of our partnering transaction; and (B) subsequent to our partnering transaction, (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our partnering transaction.
Preferred Stock
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock and will provide that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a
  155
Table of Contents
change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preferred stock outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No shares of preferred stock are being issued or registered in this offering.
Warrants
Public Stockholders’ Warrants
Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of this offering and 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction, except as described below. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares of Series A common stock. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you are separating a multiple of five units, the number of warrants issuable to you upon separation of the units will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our partnering transaction, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
We will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Series A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Series A common stock is available, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Series A common stock underlying such unit.
We have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the consummation of our partnering transaction, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC, and within 60 business days following our partnering transaction to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Series A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if our Series A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00. Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):
    •  
in whole and not in part;
    •  
at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
  156
Table of Contents
  •  
upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and
    •  
if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities - Warrants - Public Stockholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
We will not redeem the warrants for cash unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.
We have established the $18.00 per share (as adjusted) redemption criteria discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Series A common stock may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities - Warrants - Public Stockholders’ Warrants - Anti-dilution Adjustments”) as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.
No fractional shares of Series A common stock will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round down to the nearest whole number of the number of shares of Series A common stock to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the warrants are exercisable for a security other than the shares of Series A common stock pursuant to the warrant agreement (for instance, if we are not the surviving company in our partnering transaction), the warrants may be exercised for such security.
Redemption procedures and cashless exercise. If we call the warrants for redemption as described above under “— Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00,” our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” (such option, the “Cashless Exercise Option”). In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis,” our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Series A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Series A common stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Series A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361 shares of Series A common stock per warrant. The “fair market value” for this purpose shall mean the volume weighted average price of our Series A common stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this Cashless Exercise Option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of Series A common stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the “fair market value” in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be
  157
Table of Contents
issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this Cashless Exercise Option feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our partnering transaction. If we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this Cashless Exercise Option, our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had management taken advantage of this Cashless Exercise Option, as described in more detail below.
A holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the shares of Series A common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.
Anti-dilution Adjustments. If the number of outstanding shares of Series A common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of Series A common stock, or by a split-up of shares of Series A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such stock dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of shares of Series A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of Series A common stock. A rights offering to holders of Series A common stock entitling holders to purchase shares of Series A common stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of Series A common stock equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Series A common stock actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Series A common stock) multiplied by (2) one minus the quotient of (x) the price per share of Series A common stock paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (1) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Series A common stock, in determining the price payable for Series A common stock, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (2) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of Series A common stock as reported during the ten trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of Series A common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.
In addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of Series A common stock on account of such shares of Series A common stock (or other shares of our capital stock into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Series A common stock in connection with a proposed partnering transaction, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Series A common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (I) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our Series A common stock if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (II) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our partnering transaction, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of Series A common stock in respect of such event.
If the number of outstanding shares of our Series A common stock is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of Series A common stock or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar event, the number of shares of Series A common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of Series A common stock.
  158

Whenever the number of shares of Series A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of shares of Series A common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of shares of Series A common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter.
In addition, if (x) we issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities, excluding forward purchase units, for capital raising purposes in connection with the consummation of our partnering transaction at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our sponsor or Post or its other subsidiaries, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor or Post or its other subsidiaries, as applicable) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances, excluding the forward purchase units, represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our partnering transaction on the date of the completion of our partnering transaction (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our Series A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our partnering transaction (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under “Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.
In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of Series A common stock (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of Series A common stock), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a merger or consolidation in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding shares of Series A common stock), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of our Series A common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. However, if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such merger or consolidation, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such merger or consolidation that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders (other than a tender, exchange or redemption offer made by the company in connection with redemption rights held by stockholders of the company as provided for in the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or as a result of the redemption of shares of Series A common stock by the company if a proposed partnering transaction is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Series A common stock, the holder of a warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder
  159
Table of Contents
would actually have been entitled as a stockholder if such warrant holder had exercised the warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Series A common stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the warrant agreement. Additionally, if less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Series A common stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of Series A common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the per share consideration minus Black-Scholes Warrant Value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant.
The warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. You should review a copy of the warrant agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, for a description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants. The warrant agreement provides that (a) the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this prospectus, or defective provision or (ii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants and (b) all other modifications or amendments require the vote or written consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants; provided that any amendment that solely affects the terms of the private placement warrants or forward purchase warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement solely with respect to the private placement warrants or forward purchase warrants will also require at least 50% of the then outstanding private placement warrants or forward purchase warrants, respectively. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment.
The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of Series A common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of Series A common stock. After the issuance of shares of Series A common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders.
No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade.
We have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. See “Risk Factors — Our warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.” This provision applies to claims under the Securities Act but does not apply to claims under the Exchange Act or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum.
Private Placement Warrants
The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in this offering except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees: (1) they will not be
  160
Table of Contents
redeemable by us; (2) they (including the Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not be transferred, assigned or sold by our sponsor until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction (except as described herein under “Principal Stockholders - Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units”); (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4) the holders thereof (including with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than our sponsor or its permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering.
If holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of shares of Series A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Series A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “sponsor fair market value” (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the sponsor fair market value. The “sponsor fair market value” shall mean the average last reported sale price of the Series A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor and its permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether our sponsor will cease to be affiliated with us following a business combination. If our sponsor remains affiliated with us its ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We expect to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time.
Forward Purchase Units
Prior to this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement pursuant to which our sponsor will agree to acquire forward purchase units for $100,000,000, in the aggregate, in connection with our partnering transaction. Each forward purchase unit will consist of one share of Series B common stock, or a forward purchase share, and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series B common stock, or a forward purchase warrant, at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit, and will be sold in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the consummation of our partnering transaction. The terms of the forward purchase warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in this offering.
Dividends
We have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our partnering transaction. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our partnering transaction. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our partnering transaction will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future, except if we increase the size of this offering, in which case we will effect a stock dividend or other appropriate mechanism with respect to our Series F common stock immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares at 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon the consummation of this offering. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our partnering transaction, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.
Our Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent
The transfer agent for our common stock and warrant agent for our warrants will be Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We will agree to indemnify Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company in its roles
  161
Table of Contents
as transfer agent and warrant agent, its agents and each of its stockholders, directors, officers and employees against all liabilities, including judgments, costs and reasonable counsel fees that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any liability due to any gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the indemnified person or entity.
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our partnering transaction. These provisions (other than amendments relating to the appointment or removal of directors prior to our partnering transaction, which require the approval of holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock) cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock except in limited circumstances described under “— Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws — Actions Requiring Supermajority Stockholder Vote.” Our sponsor, who will beneficially own 20% of the shares of our common stock outstanding upon the closing of this offering (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units and assuming our sponsor does not purchase any units in this offering), may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Prior to our partnering transaction, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Series F common stock is required to approve the election or removal of directors. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that:
    •  
if we have not completed our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event), we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law;
    •  
prior to our partnering transaction, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to: (1) receive funds from the trust account; or (2) vote pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation on any partnering transaction;
    •  
if a stockholder vote on our partnering transaction is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our partnering transaction which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our partnering transaction and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;
    •  
as long as our securities are listed on the NYSE, our partnering transaction must occur with one or more target businesses that have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our partnering transaction;
  162
Table of Contents
  •  
if our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemptions in connection with our partnering transaction or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-partnering transaction activity, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares; and
    •  
we will not effectuate our partnering transaction solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.
Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
DGCL 203 Opt Out
Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have opted out of the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a “business combination” with:
    •  
a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock (otherwise known as an “interested stockholder”);
    •  
an affiliate of an interested stockholder; or
    •  
an associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.
A “business combination” includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 do not apply if:
    •  
our board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an “interested stockholder,” prior to the date of the transaction;
    •  
after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock; or
    •  
on or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders, and not by written consent, by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.
We have opted out of the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL because we believe this statute could prohibit or delay mergers or other change in control attempts, and thus may discourage attempts to acquire us.
Authorized Shares
Our authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to
  163
Table of Contents
raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.
Special Meeting of Stockholders
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called (i) upon the written request of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock and preferred stock or (ii) by an affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the members of the board of directors then in office.
Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations
Our amended and restated bylaws will provide for advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee of our board of directors. In order for any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, proposals seeking inclusion in our annual proxy statement must comply with the notice periods contained therein. Our amended and restated bylaws will also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. Our amended and restated bylaws will allow the chairman of the meeting at a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of meetings which may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the rules and regulations are not followed. These provisions may also defer, delay or discourage a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to influence or obtain control of us.
Action by Written Consent
After the date on which our sponsor, Post or its other subsidiaries beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 50% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company, any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with respect to such series.
Classified Board of Directors
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that prior to our partnering transaction, only holders of our Series F common stock will have the right to elect our directors and may remove members of our board of directors for any reason. Upon the consummation of our partnering transaction, our board of directors will initially be divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms. As a result, in most circumstances, a person other than our sponsor can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual stockholder meetings following our partnering transaction.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors. Subject to the terms of any preferred stock, following the consummation of our partnering transaction, any or all of the directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
  164
Table of Contents
Prior to our partnering transaction, any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of our Series F common stock, or for vacancies not resulting from removal, by the remaining directors then in office or by the sole remaining director. Following the consummation of our partnering transaction, any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office (even though less than a quorum) or by the sole remaining director.
No Cumulative Voting
The DGCL provides that stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide for cumulative voting.
Actions Requiring Supermajority Stockholder Vote
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the rights of the holders of any series of our preferred stock, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 % of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class at a meeting specifically called for such purpose, will be required in order for us to take any action to authorize (i) the amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the addition or insertion of other provisions thereto, except (a) for those as to which the laws of the State of Delaware, as then in effect, do not require stockholder consent or (b) where at least 75% of the members of the board of directors then in office have approved such change; (ii) the adoption, amendment or repeal of any provision of our amended and restated bylaws, except by the board of directors in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; (iii) the merger or consolidation of us with or into any other corporation (including pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL) unless (a) the laws of the State of Delaware, as then in effect, do not require consent by our stockholders (other than Section 251(h) of the DGCL) or (b) at least 75% of the members of the board of directors then in office have approved; (iv) the sale, lease or exchange of all, or substantially all, of our property or assets, unless at least 75% of the members of the board of directors then in office have approved; or (v) our dissolution, unless approved by at least 75% of the members of the board of directors then in office. However, if we seek stockholder approval of our partnering transaction such stockholder approval will not be subject to the foregoing.
Supermajority of Board of Directors Permitted to Amend Bylaws
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws authorize our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws by the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the members of the board of directors then in office.
Series F Common Stock Consent Right
Prior to the consummation of our partnering transaction, for so long as any shares of our Series F common stock remain outstanding, we will not have the power, without the prior vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of voting power of the shares of our Series F common stock then outstanding, voting separately as a single class to amend, alter or repeal any provision of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, if such amendment, alteration or repeal would alter or change the powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights of the Series B common stock. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the holders of our Series F common stock may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of the outstanding shares of
  165
Table of Contents
Series F common stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares of our Series F common stock were present and voted.
Exclusive Forum for Certain Lawsuits
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, another state court within the State of Delaware or, if no state court in Delaware has subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district courts of the United Stated States of America) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) to bring (1) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought or purportedly brought on behalf of our company, (2) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, stockholder, officer, employee or agent of our company to our company or our stockholders, or any claim of aiding and abetting such breach, (3) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation, or remedy under, any provision of the DGCL or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws, (5) any action asserting a claim against our company or any director or officer of our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, (6) any action, suit, or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, or (7) any action, suit or proceeding asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL; in all cases, subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph will not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or otherwise arising under federal securities laws, for which the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum.
Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also will provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees. Furthermore, the enforceability of choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. See “Risk Factors —  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each of which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with our company or our company’s directors, officers or employees.”

Securities Eligible for Future Sale
Immediately after this offering we will have 51,200,000 (or 58,820,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares, the 40,000,000 shares (or 46,000,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the outstanding founder shares (10,000,000 founder shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised and 11,500,000 founder shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) and all of the outstanding private placement units (1,200,000 private placement units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised and 1,320,000 private placement units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering.
Upon the closing of the sale of the forward purchase units, all forward purchase shares and forward purchase warrants will be restricted securities under Rule 144. Otherwise, the forward purchase units will not be subject to any transfer restrictions.
Rule 144
Pursuant to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that: (1) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale; and (2) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale.
Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares of our common stock or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of:
    •  
1% of the total number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which will equal 512,000 shares immediately after this offering (or 588,200 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full); or
    •  
the average weekly reported trading volume of the common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.
Sales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.
Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies
Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than a business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met:
    •  
the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;
    •  
the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
  167
Table of Contents
  •  
the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Current Reports on Form 8-K; and

at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.
As a result, our sponsor will be able to sell their founder shares and its private placement warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our partnering transaction.
Registration Rights
The holders of the founder shares, forward purchase shares, forward purchase warrants, private placement shares, private placement warrants and shares and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants, forward purchase warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans and upon conversion of the founder shares and the forward purchase shares) will be entitled to registration rights with respect to private placement shares, private placement warrants, forward purchase warrants, shares and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans, warrants purchased by them in the open market and shares of Series A common stock purchased by them in the open market or issuable upon (1) conversion of the founder shares, (2) exercise of the private placement warrants, (3) conversion of the forward purchase shares and shares of Series B common stock purchased in connection with our partnering transaction (if any), (4) exercise of the forward purchase warrants and (5) exercise of warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans (if any), pursuant to an investor rights agreement and forward purchase agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering requiring us to register such securities for resale. The holder of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands in any 12-month period under each agreement, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our partnering transaction and rights to require us to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, both the investor rights agreement and the forward purchase agreement will provide that we will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions, as described under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.” We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
The investor rights agreement will also provide that our sponsor will be entitled, upon consummation of our partnering transaction, to nominate three individuals for appointment to our board of directors, as long as our sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration rights described in the paragraph above.
Listing of Securities
We intend to apply to list our units, Series A common stock and warrants on the NYSE under the symbols “                .U,” “                ” and “                WS,” respectively. We expect that our units will be listed on the NYSE on or promptly after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Following the date the shares of our Series A common stock and warrants are eligible to trade separately, we anticipate that the shares of our common stock and warrants will be listed separately and as a unit on the NYSE. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on the NYSE.

UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
The following discussion is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the ownership and disposition of our units, Series A common stock and warrants, which we refer to collectively as our securities. This summary is based upon U.S. federal income tax law as of the date of this prospectus, which is subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (e.g., our sponsor, financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), taxpayers that have elected mark-to-market accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, S corporations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, investors that will hold Series A common stock or warrants as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of our securities or U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ materially from those summarized below. Furthermore, this summary does not discuss other U.S. federal tax consequences (e.g., estate or gift tax), any state, local, or non-U.S. tax considerations or the Medicare tax or alternative minimum tax nor does this summary address any person who beneficially holds both shares or our common stock and shares of Post. In addition, this summary is limited to investors that will hold our securities as “capital assets” (generally, property held for investment) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that acquired the securities pursuant to this offering (or, in the case of Series A common stock, upon exercise of warrants so acquired). No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has been or will be sought regarding any matter discussed herein. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax aspects set forth below.
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial holder of securities who or that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is:
    •  
an individual who is a United States citizen or resident of the United States;
    •  
a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes created in, or organized under the law of, the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof;
    •  
an estate the income of which is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or
    •  
a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a United States court and which has one or more United States persons (within the meaning of the Code) who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) that has in effect a valid election under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
A “non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial holder of shares who or that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our securities, the tax treatment of a partner, member or other beneficial owner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner, member or other beneficial owner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner, member or other beneficial owner level. If you are a partnership or a partner, member or other beneficial owner of a partnership holding our securities, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our securities.
THIS DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. WE URGE PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS

CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR SECURITIES, AS WELL AS THE APPLICATION OF ANY STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ESTATE AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS.
Personal Holding Company Status
We would be subject to a second level of U.S. federal income tax on a portion of our income if we are determined to be a personal holding company, or PHC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. corporation will generally be classified as a PHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if (1) at any time during the last half of such taxable year, five or fewer individuals (without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds, and charitable trusts) own or are deemed to own (pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50% of the stock of the corporation by value and (2) at least 60% of the corporation’s adjusted ordinary gross income, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for such taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among other things, dividends, interest, certain royalties, annuities and, under certain circumstances, rents).
Depending on the date and size of our partnering transaction, it is possible that at least 60% of our adjusted ordinary gross income may consist of PHC income as discussed above. In addition, depending on the concentration of our stock in the hands of individuals, including certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds, and charitable trusts, as a result of this offering, it is possible that more than 50% of our stock will be owned or deemed owned (pursuant to the constructive ownership rules) by five or fewer such persons during the last half of a taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be given that we will not become a PHC following this offering or in the future. If we are or were to become a PHC in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional PHC tax, currently 20%, on our undistributed PHC income, which generally includes our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments.
General Treatment of Units
There is no authority directly addressing the treatment, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, of instruments with terms substantially the same as the units and, therefore, their treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our Series A common stock and one-fifth of one warrant to acquire one share of our Series A common stock. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a unit, you agree to adopt such treatment for tax purposes. Each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one share of Series A common stock and the one-fifth of one warrant based on their respective relative fair market values. Under U.S. federal income tax law, each investor must make his or her own determination of such value based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Therefore, we strongly urge each investor to consult his or her tax advisor regarding the determination of value for these purposes. A holder’s initial tax basis in the Series A common stock and the warrant included in each unit should equal the portion of the purchase price of the unit allocated thereto. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of Series A common stock and one-fifth of one warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Series A common stock and the one-fifth of one warrant based on their respective relative fair market values (as determined by each such unit holder based on all the relevant facts and circumstances) at the time of disposition. The separation of the Series A common stock and warrant constituting a unit should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
The foregoing treatment of the units and a holder’s purchase price allocation are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there is no authority that directly addresses instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below. Each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state,
  170
Table of Contents
local and any foreign tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit and its components). The following discussion is based on the assumption that the characterization of the Series A common stock and warrants and the allocation described above are respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
U.S. Holders
Taxation of Distributions
If we pay distributions in cash or other property (other than certain distributions of our stock or rights to acquire our stock) to U.S. Holders of shares of our Series A common stock, such distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in our Series A common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the Series A common stock and will be treated as described under “U.S. Holders - Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock” below.
Dividends we pay to a U.S. Holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain exceptions (including dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations), and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends we pay to a non-corporate U.S. Holder will generally constitute “qualified dividends” that will be subject to tax at the preferential tax rate accorded to long-term capital gains. It is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Series A common stock described in this prospectus may prevent a U.S. Holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, as the case may be. If the holding period requirements are not satisfied, then a corporation may not be able to qualify for the dividends received deduction and would have taxable income equal to the entire dividend amount, and non-corporate U.S. Holders may be subject to tax on such dividend at regular ordinary income tax rates instead of the preferential rate that applies to qualified dividend income.
Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock
A U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, taxable exchange or other taxable disposition (which would include a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not complete a partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period) of our Series A common stock. Any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Series A common stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible to be taxed at reduced rates.
The amount of gain or loss recognized will generally be equal to the difference between (1) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition (or, if the Series A common stock is held as part of a unit at the time of the disposition, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the Series A common stock based upon the then fair market values of the Series A common stock and the warrant included in the unit) and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Series A common stock so disposed of. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Series A common stock will generally equal the U.S. Holder’s acquisition cost (that is, as discussed above, the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to a share of Series A common stock or, as discussed below, the U.S. Holder’s initial basis for Series A common stock received upon exercise of a warrant) less any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Redemption of Series A Common Stock
In the event that a U.S. Holder’s Series A common stock is redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under “Description of Securities - Common Stock” or if we purchase a U.S. Holder’s Series A common stock in an open market transaction (each of which we refer to as a “redemption”), the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Series A common stock under Section 302 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of Series A common stock under the tests described below, the tax consequences to the U.S. Holder will be the same as described under “U.S. Holders - Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock” above. If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of Series A common stock, the U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution, the tax consequences of which are described above under “U.S. Holders - Taxation of Distributions.” Whether the redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend primarily on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as a result of owning warrants) both before and after the redemption. The redemption of Series A common stock will generally be treated as a sale of the Series A common stock (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (1) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. Holder, (2) results in a “complete termination” of the U.S. Holder’s interest in us or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.
In determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also shares of our stock that are constructively owned by it. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any stock the U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include common stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. A redemption of a U.S. Holder’s stock will be substantially disproportionate with respect to the U.S. Holder if the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of common stock is, among other requirements, less than 80% of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption. Prior to our partnering transaction, the Series A common stock may not be treated as voting stock for this purpose and, consequently, this substantially disproportionate test may not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder’s interest if either (1) all of the shares of our stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (2) all of the shares of our stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other stock (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as a result of owning warrants). The redemption of the Series A common stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if the redemption results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. The IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.” A U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption, including the application of the constructive ownership rules described above.
If none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, the redemption will be treated as a corporate distribution, the tax consequences of which are described under “U.S. Holders - Taxation of Distributions,” above. After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed Series A common stock should be added to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining stock, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its warrants or possibly in other stock constructively owned by it.

Exercise of a Warrant
Except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. Holder will not recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the share of our Series A common stock received upon exercise of the warrant will generally be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment in the warrant (i.e., the portion of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for a unit that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under “- General Treatment of Units”) and the exercise price of such warrant. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Series A common stock received upon exercise of the warrant would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant; however, in either case the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the warrants.
The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current tax law. A cashless exercise may be nontaxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Series A common stock received would generally equal the holder’s tax basis in the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as not being a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Series A common stock would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant. If, however, the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Series A common stock would include the holding period of the warrant exercised.
It is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss is recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder would be deemed to have surrendered a number of warrants having an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. The U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Series A common stock received would equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment in the warrants deemed exercised (i.e., the portion of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant deemed exercised, as described above under “- General Treatment of Units”) and the exercise price of such warrants deemed exercised. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Series A common stock would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant; in either case, the holding period would not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the warrant.
Due to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, including when a U.S. Holder’s holding period would commence with respect to the Series A common stock received, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.
Sale, Taxable Exchange, Redemption or Expiration of a Warrant
Upon a sale, taxable exchange (other than by exercise), redemption (other than a redemption for Series A common stock), or expiration of a warrant, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized upon such disposition or expiration (or, if the warrant is held as part of a unit at the time of the disposition of the unit, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the warrant based on the then fair market values of the warrant and the Series A common stock constituting such unit) and (2) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the warrant (that is, the portion of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for a unit that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under “- General Treatment of Units”). Such gain or loss will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the warrant is held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year at the time of such disposition or expiration. If a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the warrant. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

Table of Contents
The tax consequences of an exercise of a warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the warrant for $0.01 as described in the section of this prospectus entitled “Description of Securities —  Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants” are unclear under current law. In the case of a cashless exercise, the exercise may be treated either as if we redeemed such warrant for Series A common stock or as an exercise of the warrant. If the cashless exercise of a warrant for Series A common stock is treated as a redemption, then such redemption generally should be treated as a tax-deferred recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in which case a U.S. Holder should not recognize any gain or loss on such redemption, and accordingly, a U.S. Holder’s basis in the Series A common stock received should equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in the warrant and the holding period of the Series A common stock would include the holding period of the warrant. If the cashless exercise of a warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the warrant is treated in the same manner as a cashless exercise of a warrant by a U.S. Holder that is not following such notice, there is some uncertainty regarding the treatment, as described above under the heading “U.S. Holders — Exercise of a Warrant.” Due to the lack of clarity under current law regarding the treatment of an exercise of a warrant after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the warrant for $0.01, there can be no assurance as to which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the exercise of a warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the warrant as described above.
Possible Constructive Distributions
The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of shares of Series A common stock for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned “Description of Securities - Warrants - Public Stockholders’ Warrants.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution is generally not a taxable event. Nevertheless, a U.S. Holder of warrants would be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the holder’s proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of shares of Series A common stock that would be obtained upon exercise or through a decrease to the exercise price, including, for example, the decrease to the exercise price of the warrants where additional shares of Series A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued in connection with the closing of our partnering transaction at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Series A common stock, as described under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) as a result of a distribution of cash or other property to the holders of shares of our Series A common stock which is taxable to such holders as a dividend. In addition, an adjustment to the exercise price or conversion rate of any of our outstanding securities (or a failure to make an adjustment to the exercise price or conversion rate of such outstanding securities) may, depending on the circumstances, result in a deemed taxable distribution to a U.S. Holder of shares of Series A common stock, if as a result of such adjustment or failure to make an adjustment, the proportionate interest of the U.S. Holder of shares of Series A common stock in our assets or earnings and profits is increased. Any constructive distribution received by a U.S. Holder would be subject to U.S. federal income tax as described under “— U.S. Holders — Taxation of Distributions” above in the same manner as if such U.S. Holder received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest without any corresponding receipt of cash.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
In general, information reporting requirements may apply to dividends paid to a U.S. Holder and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of our units, Series A common stock and warrants, unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the U.S. Holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number, a certification of exempt status or has been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding (and such notification has not been withdrawn).
Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Non-U.S. Holders
Taxation of Distributions
In general, any distributions (including constructive distributions) we make to a non-U.S. Holder of shares of our Series A common stock, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles), will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless such non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable). In the case of any constructive dividend, it is possible that this tax would be withheld from any amount owed to a non-U.S. Holder by the applicable withholding agent, including cash distributions on other property or sale proceeds from warrants or other property subsequently paid or credited to such holder. A Non-U.S. Holder that does not timely furnish the required documentation, but that qualifies for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero) the non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our Series A common stock and, to the extent such distribution exceeds the non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the Series A common stock, which will be treated as described under “Non-U.S. Holders — Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock and Warrants” below. In addition, if we determine that we are classified as a “United States real property holding corporation” (see “Non-U.S. Holders — Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock and Warrants” below), we will withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits.
Dividends we pay to a non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with such non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (or if a tax treaty applies are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. Holder) will generally not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, provided such non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification and disclosure requirements (usually by providing an IRS Form W-8ECI or other applicable form). Instead, such dividends will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at the same graduated individual or corporate rates applicable to U.S. Holders. If the non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, dividends that are effectively connected income may also be subject to a “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty).
Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Warrant
The characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of a non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of a warrant (including an exercise of a warrant occurring after our giving notice of an intention to redeem the warrant for $0.01 as described in the section of this prospectus entitled “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants”), the lapse of a warrant or the redemption of a warrant held by a non-U.S. Holder generally will correspond to the characterization described under “U.S. Holders — Exercise of a Warrant” or “U.S. Holders — Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Expiration of a Warrant” above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange, the tax consequences to the non-U.S. Holder would be the same as those described below in “Non-U.S. Holders — Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock and Warrants.”
Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock and Warrants
A non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a sale, taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of our Series A common stock, which would
  175

include a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not complete a partnering transaction within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months following an agreement in principle event) or during any Extension Period, or warrants (including an expiration or redemption of our warrants), in each case without regard to whether those securities were held as part of a unit, unless:
    •  
the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the non-U.S. Holder within the United States (and, if an applicable tax treaty so requires, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. Holder);
    •  
the non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met; or

we are or have been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the non-U.S. Holder held our Series A common stock, and, in the case where shares of our Series A common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market, the non-U.S. Holder has owned, directly or constructively, more than 5% of our Series A common stock at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or such non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for the shares of our Series A common stock. There can be no assurance that our Series A common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for this purpose.
Unless an applicable treaty provides otherwise, gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates as if the non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. resident. Any gains described in the first bullet point above of a non-U.S. Holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate). Gain described in the second bullet point above will generally be subject to a flat 30% U.S. federal income tax. Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding possible eligibility for benefits under income tax treaties.
If the third bullet point above applies to a non-U.S. Holder, gain recognized by such holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our Series A common stock or warrants will be subject to tax at generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rates. In addition, a buyer of our Series A common stock or warrants from such holder may be required to withhold U.S. income tax at a rate of 15% of the amount realized upon such disposition. We cannot determine whether we will be a United States real property holding corporation in the future until we complete a partnering transaction. We will be classified as a United States real property holding corporation if the fair market value of our “United States real property interests” equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we are or have been a “United States real property holding corporation” you are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules.
Possible Constructive Distributions
The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of shares of Series A common stock for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Stockholders’ Warrants.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution is generally not a taxable event. Nevertheless, a non-U.S. Holder of warrants would be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the holder’s proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of shares of Series A common stock that would be obtained upon exercise or through a decrease to the exercise price, including, for example, the decrease to the exercise price of the warrants where additional shares of Series A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued in connection with the closing of our partnering transaction at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Series A common stock, as described under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) as a result of a
  176
Table of Contents
distribution of cash or other property to the holders of shares of our Series A common stock which is taxable to such holders as a distribution. In addition, an adjustment to the exercise price or conversion rate of any of our outstanding securities (or a failure to make an adjustment to the exercise price or conversion rate of such outstanding securities) may, depending on the circumstances, result in a deemed taxable distribution to a U.S. Holder of shares of Series A common stock, if as a result of such adjustment or failure to make an adjustment, the proportionate interest of the U.S. Holder of shares of Series A common stock in our assets or earnings and profits is increased. Any constructive distribution received by a non-U.S. Holder would be subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding as described under “Non-U.S. Holders — Taxation of Distributions” above in the same manner as if such non-U.S. Holder received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest without any corresponding receipt of cash.
Redemption of Series A Common Stock
The characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a non-U.S. Holder’s Series A common stock pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under “Description of Securities — Common Stock” will generally correspond to the U.S. federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. Holder’s Series A common stock, as described under “U.S. Holders — Redemption of Series A Common Stock” above, and the consequences of the redemption to the non-U.S. Holder will be as described above under “Non-U.S. Holders — Taxation of Distributions” and “Non-U.S. Holders — Gain on Sale, Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Series A Common Stock and Warrants,” as applicable.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of dividends and proceeds from the sale of our securities to non-U.S. Holders that are not exempt recipients. We must report annually to the IRS and to each such holder the amount of dividends or other distributions we pay to such non-U.S. Holder on our shares of Series A common stock and the amount of tax withheld with respect to those distributions, regardless of whether withholding is required. The IRS may make copies of the information returns reporting those dividends and amounts withheld available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. Holder resides pursuant to the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or exchange of information treaty.
The gross amount of dividends and proceeds from the disposition of our Series A common stock or warrants paid to a holder that fails to provide the appropriate certification in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury regulations generally will be subject to backup withholding at the applicable rate.
Information reporting and backup withholding are generally not required with respect to the amount of any proceeds from the sale by a non-U.S. Holder of Series A common stock or warrants outside the United States through a foreign office of a foreign broker that does not have certain specified connections to the United States. However, if a non-U.S. Holder sells Series A common stock or warrants through a U.S. broker or the U.S. office of a foreign broker, the broker will generally be required to report to the IRS the amount of proceeds paid to such holder, unless the non-U.S. Holder provides appropriate certification (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable) to the broker of its status as a non-U.S. Holder or such non-U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient. In addition, for information reporting purposes, certain non-U.S. brokers with certain relationships with the United States will be treated in a manner similar to U.S. brokers.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts we withhold under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, by the IRS if the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the IRS.
All non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of information reporting and backup withholding to them.
  177

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance promulgated thereunder (commonly referred as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act” or “FATCA”) generally impose withholding at a rate of 30% in certain circumstances on dividends in respect of our securities which are held by or through certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds), unless any such institution (1) enters into, and complies with, an agreement with the IRS to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution that are owned by certain U.S. persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments, or (2) if required under an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, reports such information to its local tax authority, which will exchange such information with the U.S. authorities. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Accordingly, the entity through which our securities are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Similarly, dividends in respect of our securities held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exceptions will generally be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (1) certifies to us or the applicable withholding agent that such entity does not have any “substantial United States owners” or (2) provides certain information regarding the entity’s “substantial United States owners,” which will in turn be provided to the U.S. Department of Treasury.
Prior to the issuance of proposed U.S. Treasury regulations, such U.S. federal withholding tax under FATCA also would have applied to gross proceeds from the sale or disposition of our Series A common stock or warrants. However, the proposed U.S. Treasury regulations provide that such gross proceeds will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding taxes under FATCA. Taxpayers may rely on these proposed U.S. Treasury regulations until they are revoked or final U.S. Treasury regulations are issued. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our securities.

UNDERWRITING
Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in an underwriting agreement dated                             , 2021 we have agreed to sell to the underwriters named below, for whom Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. are acting as representatives, the following respective numbers of units:

   Number of
Units  
Evercore Group L.L.C..
   Barclays Capital Inc.
            Total
     40,000,000  
         The underwriting agreement will provide that the underwriters are obligated to purchase all the units in this offering if any are purchased, other than those units covered by the over-allotment option described below.
We have granted to the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of this prospectus to purchase on a pro rata basis up to 6,000,000 additional units at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The option may be exercised only to cover any over-allotments of units.
The underwriters propose to offer the units initially at the public offering price on the cover page of this prospectus and to selling group members at that price less a selling concession of $            per unit.
The following table summarizes the compensation and estimated expenses we will pay:

Includes $0.35 per unit, or $14,000,000 (or $16,100,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in the aggregate, payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions to be placed in a trust account located in the United States as described herein. Up to 25% of the deferred underwriting commissions ($3,500,000 or $4,025,000 if the option to purchase additional units is exercised in full) may be paid at the sole discretion of our management team to the underwriters in the allocations determined by our management team and/or to third parties not participating in this offering (but who are members of FINRA) that assist us in consummating our partnering transaction. The deferred commissions will be released only on completion of a partnering transaction, in an amount equal to $0.35 multiplied by the number of shares of Series A common stock sold as part of the units in this offering, as described in this prospectus.
We estimate that our out-of-pocket expenses for this offering will be approximately $1,500,000. We have agreed to pay for the FINRA-related fees and expenses of the underwriters’ legal counsel, not to exceed $25,000.
The representative has informed us that the underwriters do not intend to make sales to discretionary accounts.
We, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed that we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, any units, warrants, common stock or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of common stock; provided, however, that we may (1) issue and sell the private placement units; (2) issue and sell the additional
  179
Table of Contents
units to cover our underwriters’ over-allotment option (if any); (3) register with the SEC pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in this offering, the resale of the private placement units or the securities underlying same and the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of the warrants and the founder shares; and (4) issue securities in connection with our partnering transaction. However, the foregoing shall not apply to the forfeiture of any founder shares pursuant to their terms or any transfer of founder shares to any current or future independent director of the Company (as long as such current or future independent director is subject to the terms of the letter agreement, filed herewith, at the time of such transfer; and as long as, to the extent any Section 16 reporting obligation is triggered as a result of such transfer, any related Section 16 filing includes a practical explanation as to the nature of the transfer). Evercore Group L.L.C. and Barclays Capital Inc. in their sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice.
Our sponsor will agree not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of our partnering transaction; and (B) subsequent to our partnering transaction, (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our partnering transaction, subject to certain exceptions described herein under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units.” Any permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units” would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements as our sponsor with respect to any founder shares.
The private placement warrants (including the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our partnering transaction (except with respect to permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Stockholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Units”).
We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in that respect.
We expect our units to be listed on the NYSE, under the symbol “                .U” and, once the Series A common stock and warrants begin separate trading, to have our Series A common stock and warrants listed on the NYSE under the symbols “                ” and “                WS,” respectively.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. Consequently, the initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the representative.
The determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we were an operating company. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies, prior offerings of those companies, our management, our capital structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the units, Series A common stock or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our units, Series A common stock or warrants will develop and continue after this offering.
If we do not complete our partnering transaction, the underwriters have agreed that: (1) the underwriters will forfeit any rights or claims to their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued
  180
Table of Contents
interest thereon, then in the trust account; and (2) that the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro rata basis, together with any accrued interest thereon (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) to the public stockholders.
In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
    •  
Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.
    •  
Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of units in excess of the number of units the underwriters are obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of units over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of units that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short position, the number of units involved is greater than the number of units in the over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option and/or purchasing units in the open market.
    •  
Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the units in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of units to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the over-allotment option. If the underwriters sell more units than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying units in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering.
    •  
Penalty bids permit the representative to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the units originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.
These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our units or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the units. As a result, the price of our units may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on the NYSE or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.
We are not under any contractual obligation to engage any of the underwriters to provide any services for us after this offering, but we may do so at our discretion. However, any of the underwriters may introduce us to potential target businesses or assist us in raising additional capital in the future, including by acting as a placement agent in a private offering or underwriting or arranging debt financing. If any of the underwriters provide services to us after this offering, we may pay such underwriter fair and reasonable fees that would be determined at that time in an arm’s length negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with any of the underwriters and no fees for such services will be paid to any of the underwriters prior to the date that is 60 days from the date of this prospectus, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriters’ compensation in connection with this offering, and we may pay the underwriters of this offering or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us in connection with the completion of a business combination. Any fees we may pay the underwriters or their affiliates for services rendered to us after this offering may be contingent on the completion of a business combination and may be paid in other than cash. The underwriters or their affiliates that provide these services to us may have a potential conflict of interest given that the underwriters are entitled to the deferred portion of
  181
Table of Contents
their underwriting compensation for this offering only if a partnering transaction is completed within the specified timeframe.
Some of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates, including our sponsor. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. In particular, affiliates of Barclays Capital Inc. are lenders under our sponsor’s credit agreement and hold certain of our sponsor’s outstanding indebtedness.
In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites maintained by one or more of the underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering and one or more of the underwriters participating in this offering may distribute prospectuses electronically. The representative may agree to allocate a number of units to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the underwriters and selling group members that will make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.
The units are offered for sale in those jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere where it is lawful to make such offers.
Each of the underwriters has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or delivered and will not offer, sell or deliver any of the units directly or indirectly, or distribute this prospectus or any other offering material relating to the units, in or from any jurisdiction except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations thereof and that will not impose any obligations on us except as set forth in the underwriting agreement.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholder and the Board of Directors of
Post Holdings Partnering Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Post Holdings Partnering Corporation (the “Company”) as of January 27, 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholder’s equity and cash flows for the period from January 27, 2021 (inception) through January 27, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 27, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from January 27, 2021 (inception) through January 27, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.

POST HOLDINGS PARTNERING CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Post Holdings Partnering Corporation (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on January 27, 2021. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that the Company has not yet identified (“Business Combination”).
As of January 27, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from January 27, 2021 (inception) through January 27, 2021 relates to the Company’s formation and the Proposed Public Offering, which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Proposed Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
The Company’s sponsor, PHPC Sponsor, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”). The Company’s ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through a proposed public offering (the “Proposed Public Offering”) of 40,000,000 units of the Company (each, a “Unit” and collectively, the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Series A common stock included in the Units, the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Unit (or 46,000,000 Units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which is discussed in Note 3, and the sale of 1,200,000 Units (or 1,320,000 Units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per Unit (each, a “Private Placement Unit” and collectively, the “Private Placement Units”), in a private placement to the Sponsor that will close simultaneously with the Proposed Public Offering.
The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Proposed Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Upon the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least $10.00 per Public Share sold in the Proposed Public Offering, including a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units, will be held in a trust account (“Trust Account”), located in the United States at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market fund meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.
The Company will provide the holders (the “Public Stockholders”) of Public Shares, with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or
  F-7

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay income taxes). The per-share amount to be distributed to Public Stockholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 5).
These Public Shares will be classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, only if a majority of the common shares, represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, voted at a stockholder meeting are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which the Company will adopt upon the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering (the “Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial stockholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined below in Note 4) the shares underlying the Private Placement Units, and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. Subsequent to the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering, the Company will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (ii) to clear all trades with the Company’s legal counsel prior to execution. In addition, the initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares, the shares underlying the Private Placement Units and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of its Business Combination and does not conduct redemptions in connection with its Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association will provide that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Series A common shares sold in the Proposed Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company.
The Company’s Sponsor, officers and directors (the “initial stockholders”) have agreed not to propose an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) that would modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to provide holders of its Public Shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Company’s Public Shares if the Company does not complete its Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Proposed Public Offering (the “Combination Period”) or with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of Public

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  Stockholders, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Series A common shares in conjunction with any such amendment.
If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay for its income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and its board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
The initial stockholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and the shares underlying the Private Placement Units held by them if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial stockholders acquire Public Shares in or after the Proposed Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 5) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Proposed Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (excluding the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.
  F-9
Table of Contents
POST HOLDINGS PARTNERING CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  The Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its anticipated obligations over the next year from the issuance of these financial statements. In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB’s Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,” management has determined that the Company has access to funds from the Sponsor that are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of the Company until the earlier of the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering or one year from the issuance of these financial statements.
Emerging Growth Company
The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
Risks and Uncertainties
Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the pandemic could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.
  F-10
Table of Contents
POST HOLDINGS PARTNERING CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Financial Instruments
The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under the FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.
Deferred Offering Costs
Deferred offering costs consist of legal fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the Proposed Public Offering and that will be charged to stockholder’s equity upon the completion of the Proposed Public Offering. Should the Proposed Public Offering prove to be unsuccessful, these deferred costs, as well as additional expenses to be incurred, will be charged to operations.
Net Loss Per Common Share
The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period excluding shares of common stock subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of Series F common stock that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters (as further described in Note 4). At January 27, 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into shares of common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the period presented.
Income Taxes
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Deferred tax assets were deemed immaterial as of January 27, 2021.
FASB ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There were no unrecognized tax benefits as of January 27, 2021. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of January 27, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any

  issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.
The provision for income taxes was deemed to be de minimis for the period from January 27, 2021 (inception) through January 27, 2021.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
NOTE 3. PROPOSED PUBLIC OFFERING
Pursuant to the Proposed Public Offering, the Company will offer for sale up to 40,000,000 Units (or 46,000,000 Units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit will consist of one Series A common share and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one Series A common share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 6).
NOTE 4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Founder Shares
On January 27, 2021, the Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of 11,500,000 Series F common shares (the “Founder Shares”). The Sponsor has agreed to forfeit up to an aggregate of 1,500,000 Founder Shares to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full by the underwriters. The forfeiture will be adjusted to the extent that the over-allotment option is not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Founder Shares will represent 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Proposed Public Offering. If the Company increases or decreases the size of the Proposed Public Offering, the Company will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to the Series F common shares prior to the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering in such amount as to maintain the number of Founder Shares at 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares upon the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering.
The Initial Stockholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier if, subsequent to the initial Business Combination, the closing price of the Series A common share equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, capitalization of shares, share dividends, rights issuances, subdivisions reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination, and (B) the date following the completion of the initial Business Combination on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their Series A common shares for cash, securities or other property.
Private Placement
In connection with the Proposed Public Offering, the Sponsor has committed to purchase an aggregate of 1,200,000 Private Placement Units (or 1,320,000 Private Placement Units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit ($12,000,000 in the aggregate, or $13,200,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private

  placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of the Proposed Public Offering. Each Private Placement Unit will consist of one share of Series A common stock and one-fifth of one warrant (the “Private Placement Warrant”). Each whole Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one share of Series A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Units will be added to the proceeds from the Proposed Public Offering to be held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Private Placement Warrants.
Forward Purchase
In connection with the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering, the Company will enter into a forward purchase agreement with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor will commit to purchase from the Company up to 10,000,000 forward purchase units (“Forward Purchase Units”), consisting of one share of Series B common stock, or a “Forward Purchase Share,” and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, or a “Forward Purchase Warrant,” for $10.00 per forward purchase unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000,000, in a private placement that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial Business Combination. The proceeds from the sale of these Forward Purchase Units, together with the amounts available to us from the Trust Account (after giving effect to any redemptions of Public Shares) and any other equity or debt financing obtained by us in connection with the initial Business Combination, will be used to satisfy the cash requirements of the initial Business Combination, including funding the purchase price and paying expenses and retaining specified amounts to be used by the post-Business Combination company for working capital or other purposes. To the extent that the amounts available from the Trust Account and other financing are sufficient for such cash requirements, the Sponsor may purchase less than 10,000,000 Forward Purchase Units. The terms of the Forward Purchase Warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the redeemable warrants included in the Units being issued in the Proposed Public Offering.
Related Party Loans
On January 27, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $300,000 to be used for the payment of costs related to the Proposed Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”). The Note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earlier of December 31, 2021 and the closing of the Proposed Public Offering. The Company intends to repay the Note from the proceeds of the Private Placement Units not being placed in the Trust Account. Subsequent to January 27, 2021, the Company borrowed approximately $120,000 under the Note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
In addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company may repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $2.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into Units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per Unit. The Units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of January 27, 2021, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

  Administrative Services Agreement
The Company will enter into an agreement that will provide that, commencing on the date that the Company’s securities are first listed on NYSE through the earlier of consummation of the initial Business Combination and its liquidation, the Company will pay the Sponsor $40,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of the Company’s management team.
In addition, the Sponsor, officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on the Company’s behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable Business Combinations. The audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by the Company to the Sponsor, officers or directors, or the Company’s or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial Business Combination will be made from funds held outside the Trust Account.

On January 27, 2021, the Company issued 11,500,000 shares of Series F common stock, including an aggregate of up to 1,500,000 shares of Series F common stock that are subject to forfeiture to the Company by the Sponsor for no consideration to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part, so that the number of shares of Series F common stock will equal 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock after the Proposed Public Offering.
Prior to the Company’s initial business combination, holders of the Series A common stock, Series B common stock, if any, and holders of the Series F common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders, including any vote in connection with the Company’s initial Business Combination, and vote together as a single class; provided that, prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination, only holders of the Series F common stock will have the right to elect the Company’s directors and remove members of the Company’s board of directors for any reason. These provisions of the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended if approved by holders of more than 50% of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock entitled to vote thereon as well as more than 50% of the outstanding Series F common stock.
Following the Company’s initial Business Combination, holders of the Series A common stock and holders of the Series B common stock will generally vote together as a single class on matters presented for a stockholder vote, except as required by Delaware law or stock exchange rule, with each share of Series A common stock entitling the holder to one vote per share and each share of Series B common stock entitling the holder to ten votes per share.
Holders of the Series C common stock will not be entitled to any voting powers, except as otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rule. When so required, holders of Series C common stock will be entitled to 1/100th of a vote for each share of such stock held.
Series F common stock are automatically convertible into shares of the Series B common stock at the time of the Company’s initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis and, prior to and following the Company’s initial Business Combination, each share of Series B common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one share of the Series A common stock.
Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination

  and (b) 12 months from the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the consummation of its initial Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration statement covering the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Series A common stock until the Public Warrants expire or are redeemed. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, the Company will be required to permit holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis. However, no Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company’s shares of Series A common stock are at the time of any exercise of a Public Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.
The Public Warrants have an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments, and will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Series A common stock or equity-linked securities, excluding Forward Purchase Units, for capital raising purposes in connection with the consummation of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Series A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or affiliates of the Sponsor, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or affiliates of the Sponsor, as applicable) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances, excluding the Forward Purchase Units, represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Series A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the Public Warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $18.00 per share redemption trigger prices described below under “Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00” and “Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under “Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.

  The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00:
Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants):
    •  
in whole and not in part;
    •  
at a price of $0.01 per warrant;
    •  
upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and
    •  
if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Series A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
The Company will not redeem the warrants for cash unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.
If the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, the management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis,” management will consider, among other factors, the cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of Series A common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Series A common stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Series A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “fair market value” of the Series A common stock (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) 0.361 shares of Series A common stock per warrant (subject to adjustment).
Redemption of warrants when the price per share of Series A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00:
Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the Private Placement Warrants):
    •  
in whole and not in part;
    •  
at a price of $0.10 per warrant provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares of Series A common stock to be determined by reference to an agreed table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” (as defined below) of Series A common stock;

    •  
upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption;
    •  
if, and only if, the last reported sale price of our Series A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted) on the trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and
    •  
if, and only if, there is an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Series A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating thereto available throughout the 30-day period after written notice of redemption is given.
The “fair market value” of our Series A common stock for the above purpose shall mean the volume weighted average price of our Series A common stock during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. This redemption feature differs from the typical warrant redemption features used in other blank check offerings. The Company will provide its warrant holders with the final fair market value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends. In no event will the warrants be exercisable in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 shares of Series A common stock per warrant (subject to adjustment).
In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.
NOTE 7. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to January 27, 2021, the Company borrowed approximately $120,000 under the Note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. The Company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to February 9, 2021, the date that the financial statements were available to be issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that all of our directors, officers, employees and agents shall be entitled to be indemnified by us to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”). Section 145 of the DGCL concerning indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents is set forth below.
Section 145. Indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents; insurance.
    (a)
A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person’s conduct was unlawful.
    (b)
A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the

  corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
    (c)
To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.
    (d)
Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.
    (e)
Expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by former officers and directors or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate.
    (f)
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person’s official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. A right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation or a bylaw shall not be eliminated or impaired by an amendment to such provision after the occurrence of the act or omission that is the subject of the civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification or advancement of expenses is sought, unless the provision in effect at the time of such act or omission explicitly authorizes such elimination or impairment after such action or omission has occurred.
    (g)
A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person’s status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this section.

For purposes of this section, references to “the corporation” shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

    (j)
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification brought under this section or under any by law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may summarily determine a corporation’s obligation to advance expenses (including attorneys’ fees).
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers, and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in a successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to the court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
In accordance with Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, will provide that no director shall be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such limitation on or exemption from liability is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is to eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders (through stockholders’ derivative suits on our behalf) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director, including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior, except, as restricted by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL. However, this provision does not limit or eliminate our rights or the rights of any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director’s duty of care.
If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then, in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the liability of our

directors to us or our stockholders will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation limiting or eliminating the liability of directors, whether by our stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by applicable law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to further limit or eliminate the liability of directors on a retroactive basis.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that we will, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, indemnify our current and former officers and directors, as well as those persons who, while directors or officers of our corporation, are or were serving as directors, officers, employees or agents of another entity, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, in connection with any threatened, pending or completed proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by any such person in connection with any such proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person eligible for indemnification pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will be indemnified by us in connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by our board of directors, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification.
The right to indemnification which will be conferred by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is a contract right that includes the right to be paid by us the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding referenced above in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by our officer or director (solely in the capacity as an officer or director of our corporation) will be made only upon delivery to us of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such officer or director, to repay all amounts so advanced if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or otherwise.
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which any person covered by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have or hereafter acquire under law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation affecting indemnification rights, whether by our stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by applicable law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also permit us, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other that those specifically covered by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Our bylaws, which we intend to adopt immediately prior to the closing of this offering, include the provisions relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights consistent with those which will be set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide for a right of indemnity to bring a suit in the event a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses is not paid in full by us within a specified period of time. Our bylaws also permit us to purchase and maintain insurance, at our expense, to protect us and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of our corporation or another entity, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our amended and restated bylaws affecting indemnification rights, whether by our board of directors, stockholders or by changes in applicable law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless otherwise required by applicable law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.
We will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors a form of which is to be filed as Exhibit 10.7 to this Registration Statement. These agreements will require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.
Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Registration Statement, we have agreed to indemnify the underwriters and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify us against certain civil liabilities that may be incurred in connection with this offering, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.
Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.
In January 2021, PHPC Sponsor, LLC (our “sponsor”) purchased an aggregate of 11,500,000 founder shares, with a purchase price of approximately $0.002 per share. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock (excluding the private placement shares underlying the private placement units) upon completion of this offering. Such securities were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Our sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation D.
In addition, our sponsor will commit, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase from us an aggregate of 1,200,000 (or 1,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement units at $10.00 per unit (for an aggregate purchase price of $12,000,000 or $13,200,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). This purchase will take place on a private placement basis simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering. This issuance will be made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
Prior to or in connection with this offering, we will enter into a forward purchase agreement pursuant to which our sponsor will agree to acquire forward purchase units for $100,000,000, in the aggregate, in connection with our partnering transaction. Each forward purchase unit will consist of one share of Series B common stock, or a forward purchase share, and one-fifth of one warrant to purchase one share of Series A common stock, or a forward purchase warrant, at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit, and will be sold in a private placement that will close substantially concurrently with the consummation of our partnering transaction. The terms of the forward purchase warrants will generally be identical to the terms of the redeemable warrants included in the units being issued in this offering.
No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales.

Item 17. Undertakings.
    (a)
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
    (b)
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
    (c)
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:
    (1)
For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
    (2)
For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
    (3)
For the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser, if the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.
    (4)
For the purpose of determining liability of a registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of an undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:
